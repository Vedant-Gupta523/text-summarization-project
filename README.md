# text-summarization-project

## What it does ##

Takes a URL of a news article (mainly compatible with Medium and some other sites) as an input and outputs the follow:

1. An extractive summary (Abstractive coming soon)
2. Original word count
3. Summarized word count
4. Percent reduction
5. Reading time reduction
6. A prediction for what subject the article correlates to (as of now only chooses between Science, Technology and Life)

## How to use ##

- Download all files and keep in one folder
- Run textsummarizer.py in your console or any Python Interpreter and follow the prompts. 
- You can use the database_builder_fixed.py to create your own database of articles (the current one is very small). It will automatically write to subject_freq.csv

#### Notes: ####

- The abstractive text summarizer is currently under development and isn't in the code at the moment.
- New updates are always coming out
