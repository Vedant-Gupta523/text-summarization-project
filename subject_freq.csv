" This includes simple everyday devices like house lamps or coffee makers, to the watch you wear on your wrist or even the car you drive. Every smart device is embedded with a sensor or mini computer processor that can configure data and send that information to cloud computing servers through a secure internet connection. These cloud computing servers are also known as common IoT platforms that provide the common language for a set of diverse devices and applications to communicate with one another. Or in this particular example, your car knew exactly what was wrong with it, told the manufacturer, scheduled a time for you to come into the nearest certified dealer, and had the parts ready for your car long before you knew what the issue was. Impact on Businesses With increased data at their fingertips concerning the state of their product, and how users are consuming it, companies can use this information to improve on the product’s next iteration and even reduce cost/waste. For example, by continuously collecting information on all cars of the same model, the manufacturer not only has historical data to pull from, but the manufacturer can gain a better understanding how their product has played out in the field. If the same brake issue appears to be a reoccurring issue with other cars, the manufacturer can pinpoint which specific factory the cars were made at, whether or not they used the same parts, or if they came off the inventory line the same day. More important than ever, as we transition to a world of connected devices, companies are trying to determine how best to protect their information for the sake of their business and their consumers.",TECHNOLOGY
" “The two-year project, which relied on data from researchers in more than 130 countries documenting the causes of disease and premature deaths in recent decades, found that poor air quality was the most significant pollution-related killer.” In order to improve air quality in polluted areas, we need to start to meticulously measure, monitor, and manage pollution. Currently, when cities start environmental programs to monitor air pollution, officials usually purchase full-scale air quality monitoring stations. Networks of connected sensors gather and send data to the processing center to identify high pollution, observe changes during different periods, and take appropriate action. We believe that stationary sensors are a great way to gather relevant pollution data but limitations exist which can constrain efficient environmental program realization. In 2018 we have collaborated with ITMO University and DAO IPCI to explore the opportunity of using mobile robotics equipped with sensors for environmental monitoring purposes. The research consisted of 3 major components: The studies were carried out by simultaneously measuring the pollutants with drone sensors and standard eco-analytical methods most commonly used in environmental monitoring and control (using portable gas analyzers, collecting and analyzing samples by chromatographic, spectrophotometric methods). As expected, results indicate high convergence of the results obtained by drone sensors and portable gas analyzers when measuring the content of gaseous pollutants in atmospheric air. This proves that it is feasible to use mobile robots, such as drones, to collect data about greenhouse gases (CO2, CO, NO, SO2) and to perform environmental monitoring at scale. To organize online environmental monitoring in an urban environment with its complex system of horizontal and vertical movement of air masses, it is necessary to organize a network of stationary measuring systems and UAVs equipped with sensors. The real world tests proved that the combination of stationary measuring systems and mobile robots can result in the most flexible and accurate environmental monitoring. Dczd.tech is suitable for applications involving different kinds of mobile robots, such as aerial drones, ground rovers, and autonomous cars, as well as waterborne drones! As a part of our effort to develop sustainable solutions for environmental monitoring, we have developed a solution for water inspections using the same stack of decentralized technologies. To restore the ecological balance of water bodies that have reached toxic stages, as is observed on the Volga, it is necessary to organize monitoring systems with a significant number of measuring stations and real-time continuous monitoring. Creating a network of autonomous waterborne drones for measuring nutrients in water will allow to obtain operational information about the current state of the water body in different areas which, in turn, will allow to determine the source of pollution and take appropriate action. The use of autonomous drones allows collecting accurate data about air pollution in specific locations and times to regulate natural capital markets. We have been working on an interface that allows environmental program operators to order autonomous inspection missions using mobile robots. We expect that mobile robotics can significantly improve the level of environmental control in cities, as well as in areas that require frequent monitoring of gas emissions, such as industrial facilities, landfills, waste recycling sites, oil and gas refineries, ports, roads, etc. Dczd.tech will continue working on solutions that will allow organizations and governments to set up environmental monitoring with the help of mobile robots as a part of our mission to help companies hire robots!",TECHNOLOGY
" He points out that impressive though the technosphere is, in improving quality of life and outgrowing even nation states in power, failing to recognise it as entirely a construct of the human intellect, subject to its boundaries, as well as those of Nature, is dangerous and too common a fallacy of modern thinking. As millenials increasingly shun brands without a purpose, tech companies come around to the idea that sci-fi fueled solutionism and ever-faster spinning wheels of innovation might actually benefit from checks and balances. Sustainable digitalization is the order of the day, and this doodle helps remind us that exciting and impactful though all the stuff on the left may be, that stuff on the right sets the limits, and is what people actually care about. A big takeaway from the Digital Detox and Screen Time debates is that regardless if we look at the people at the receiving end of what we put out as Customers, Users, Citizens or, y’know, People, we must recognise that all they have to spend in life is time and attention, and our task is to help them spend it well. This second doodle helps capture brand identity and evaluate ideas, towards the making only what people will love. Scandinavian Design aesthetic, understated copy, urban career+adventure late-twenty-somethings in sparse Golden Hour moments in stern Scandinavian scenery, conscious modern electronica in minor key, local hand crafted interior details. This actually covers two opposite mindsets, which are tricky to balance: at any one moment, we may want to save a person’s time and attention, or make (not necessarily take) the most of it. Example #1: Scandinavian Car Brand, luxury car concept: ceiling projection, scent and custom soundscapes evoke Scandinavian nature and helps weary businessmen unwind, making the most of urban transportation. Example #2: Scandinavian Car Brand, concierge service: digital keys and app enable a range of services delivered directly to your car–goods, valet, fuel & wash– offering convenience and saving precious time on everyday tasks. It captures the deep, transformative effect our brand or product (supposedly) has on life, society and world, and helps align brand vision & mission with customer ideals to achieve life journey fit. It is the domain of leaders, marketers, concept developers and strategists, conveyed through founding stories, mission statements, top-line copy, visionary concepts. Example #1: Scandinavian Car Brand, Vision 2020: “No one should be killed or seriously injured in a new car of our make.” This statement taps into company heritage, directs product development and frames new feature launches. Example #2: Global Toy Brand mission statement: “To inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow.” This emphasises their deep knowledge of children’s development and the role of all their products in achieving that. Strong brands, ideas and products deliver all three––Meaning, Pleasure and Flow––and doing so takes a strong collaboration between all disciplines outlined above. A commendable step towards bridging the cultural gap between these three disciplines, hailing as they are from the different home planets of design, business and tech. The above model is not only useful for management, but for understanding the nature of problems, which is key when looking at the final big topic in tech in the last doodle. At the peak of the big AI buzz/scare, back in April, Venkatesh Rao put out a brilliant, entertaining ramble about the ill posed threat of AI as a Man vs Machine intelligence arms race. It argues the latter as a supreme survival strategy and humanity’s defining trait (The B-Ark is a reference to geek favourite Hitch-hiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, in which an optimisation of sorts ends up upending civilisation in an unfortunate twist of fate.) With even more luck, we might follow the breakneck pace of development in the world’s largest data pool without feeling the need to throw “Orwellian dystopia” into every other sentence.",TECHNOLOGY
"  This week I’m heading to CES, the trade show featuring latest gadgets and gizmos galore. While I look forward to seeing what CES has to offer, my technology wish for 2019 isn’t a piece of shiny new hardware. My hope for 2019 is that our leading technology companies communicate their practices and policies with more transparency. Here’s why: Each week brought new headlines presenting big tech as the bad guy. Apple throttling performance of older iPhones. Most of the blunders stem from trade-offs that companies faced when designing their products and services. In the final weeks of 2017, reports surfaced that Apple throttles the CPU performance of older iPhones. The narrative spread that it’s all part of a planned obsolescence conspiracy: Apple makes old iPhones worse so users will upgrade to the latest model. After the backlash, Apple issued a statement that framed the issue as a trade-off between battery life and performance. Apple described how they, “delivered a software update that improves power management during peak workloads to avoid unexpected shutdowns” as batteries age. There’s an unshakeable story cemented in the minds of consumers: installing new software will make my older phone run more slowly, all because Apple wants me to spend more money. In a press release last week, Tim Cook stated that “customers are taking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.” These replacements harmed sales of the latest iPhone models. Imagine if Apple disclosed their policy in a slide at WWDC, when they announced the latest version of iOS. People may have grumbled, but Apple would have gotten ahead of the controversy. If you need to make a change, inform your users about why you’ve made your decision, and tell them what you’re going to do before you do it. When policy changes, it’s likely to be unpopular with a subset of a company’s users. However, these users are more likely to accept a change if they understand the reasoning behind it. Apple included their reason for slowing down iPhones in their press release, but it was buried in their message. Technology evolves more quickly than typical users can learn how new technology works. “How else do you explain me seeing an ad for a product I talked about, but I never searched for?” Average users don’t know what ad-targeting is, nor how sophisticated it’s become. If you’re making a change that may upset some portion of your users, don’t bury it in your byzantine Terms of Service agreement. 2018’s controversies show that people are aware of the massive influence technology companies have over what people see. While the technical ineptitude of our elected representatives is laughable, at least we saw bipartisan consensus that big tech possesses great power and that we should hold big tech to a higher standard. Technology platforms including Patreon and Pinterest removed various hate groups and extremists. Moreover, Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube will be making more decisions about what individuals and publications have authority. If big tech doesn’t adopt more transparent policies, the backlash will only get worse. This week, we’ll see CES keynotes from executives painting grand visions of how AI/5G/Blockchain/Autonomous Vehicles will usher in a new era of innovation. Journalists will write get hands-on with new gadgets and spread stories about the latest trends in technology. I hope these journalists hold big tech to a high standard, and that they educate their audience about the trade-offs that go into making consumer technology products. I hope that when there’s a controversy that they investigate and report on technology policies without oversimplifying and sensationalizing the truth. My wish for CES and for the year ahead is that the technology industry learns the lessons of 2018 and that it makes transparency a priority.",TECHNOLOGY
"  Apple and Samsung have both shown weakening in China sales as trade war rhetoric appears to have stimulated Chinese consumers to buy more local brands like Huawei. Apple has a new partnership with Samsung, but both appear losers to Chinese smart phone brands. Apple wants to pivot to “services”, which according to Tim Cook has ballooned into a $41 Billion cash-cow for the moment. Apple Music is already being beaten by the likes of Spotify (better AI) and Tencent Music (bigger market). Amid some very odd warnings and iPhone sales metrics changes, Apple is clearly not the company it used to be. With an economic slowdown likely approaching in 2019 and a global recession in 2020, a luxury brand like Apple can’t hope to possibly do well in their chief cash cow of iPhones moving forwards. Apple’s stock has been hammered recently due to the bearish sentiment on FANG recently, and more indications that Apple’s internal culture of innovation is failing. Apple’s sales warnings and weakness in China underlies the destructive power of the trade and tech wars between America and China. Apple CEO Tim Cook sent a note to investors warning that first quarter revenue would reach about $84 billion, lower than the $89 billion-$93 billion the company had previously guided. ApplePay did not realize its potential, though I think it’s safe to say the AppleWatch matured into a stellar wearable product, albeit a premium luxury consumer product. Some would argue that Apple needs to acquire something to keep its magic, but that’s not typically in Apple’s DNA. But Apple’s future in China is over, it will lose marketshare in a significant way in 2019 I expect. If China can snuff out foreign competitors like Korean brands, there’s no reason to expect even successful brands like Apple or Starbucks have a long-term future in China. Apple is an awkward outdated luxury sector brand in a space where the repurchase cycle is will get hit hard by a global recession in the 2019 to 2021 period. Apple needs to untether itself from the past, and the iPhone to realize its next potential. Apple has incredible customer satisfaction and loyalty in the industry, but it has to convert that to the future with new products and real innovation. However, let’s not be naive, Apple’s decline in iPhone shipments poses an immense risk to its strong services growth. Apple’s ability to increase its average selling price for the iPhone is a boon and a curse to its brand reputation. In Apple’s last fiscal year, the company generated $100 billion in revenue not tied to the iPhone, Cook says. The AppleWatch can flirt with AFib or ECGs but that’s not the kind of innovation one expects from a company with the kinds of talent and cash Apple possesses. Apple has become more unloved by Wall Street analysts than at any time in the past 14 years and it should concern Apple geekdom and fanboys. Apple’s services, which include the App Store, iTunes, Apple Pay, Apple Music and iCloud, have been growing rapidly quarter over quarter, but is that a definitive future?",TECHNOLOGY
"  Amazon’s voice recognition software only listens when you say the word “Alexa,” right? After you say the magic word, your Alexa-enabled device must listen for your request, interpret it, and respond. Just how much does Amazon really listen to inside your home? How much you really know about how voice technology works when you unboxed your Alexa-enabled device? You may have assumed your Echo or Dot listened and responded using the small computer housed inside the device itself. Now that you know that your voice recordings are being sent via the internet to a centralized location, you may have assumed Amazon will need to store that data for some period of time — for example, to use its Natural Language Processing algorithms to interpret your request for a weather report (or to buy a pizza), gather that information, and then send it back to your device for it to speak the response. The transaction happens so quickly that you assume Amazon would have no reason to keep the recording of your voice any longer than a few seconds. Think of how much storage space Amazon would require for all of the audio files. Imagine for a moment that you were curious about what, precisely, your Amazon Echo or Dot device recorded in your home. To satisfy that curiosity and put your mind at ease, you ask Amazon to send you a copy of the data your device has collected since you bought it. Imagine your horror as you open the attachments and begin listening to the recordings: A discussion of what to have for dinner, two children arguing over a toy, a woman talking to her partner as she gets into the shower. You weren’t really sure if Amazon would keep recordings at all. With equal parts relief and horror, you realize you are listening to someone else’s Echo recordings! As it turns out, all of your assumptions about voice technology were wrong. It is precisely what happened when a German citizen who requested his data files from Amazon under the European Union’s GDPR regulation. He expected to get a list of the products he has purchased, how he paid, and other commercial profile data Amazon compiled. According to the story originally reported by the German investigative magazine c’t, Amazon admitted the mistake, citing human error in sending him the wrong file. Also, Amazon was only compelled to comply with the request for data because the requestor was a European Union citizen. To put it in even simpler terms, if you own an Amazon Alexa-enabled device, Jeff Bezos could be the least creepy person listening to you right now. Or asked a different way: Is that weather report worth someone at Amazon listening to: Are you okay with a random person (who received your data file by mistake) listening to that? I used to believe this was a “boogieman” issue — that worst-case scenarios like the one described didn’t really happen. The tyranny of menus and why is “voice” such a big deal. To understand why companies are investing so much in voice recognition technology, and why they risk invading your privacy, you have to understand how objectively poor today’s “digital” experience is and how it got that way. Voice is the natural way humans interact with others and their environment. But in the early days of the internet, interactive voice technology was neither advanced enough nor cheap enough to use outside of a few advanced laboratories. The most cost-effective voice technologies of the day were “telephone menu tree” systems that infuriated even the most patient callers. As just one example, think about this simple use case: I would like to play Prince’s “1999” on my iPhone. Or, consider this voice-based alternative: “Siri, play Prince’s 1999.” Four words. One voice command step. Menus don’t only dominate the user interface of smartphones, computers, tablets, and websites, but we find them everywhere — kiosks, airport terminals, medical devices, automobiles, and home appliances. Think about it: That infuriating menu in your Toyota Camry, your CPAP machine, or your GE refrigerator is an ugly holdover from the early days of GopherNet and ARPANET … just like the QWERTY keyboard is an ugly holdover from the early days of IBM typewriters. Voice interactions are different — and not the type of robotic voice commands you give your car; those are simply audio menus, and they are terrible — no, the true potential of voice is unlocked with Natural Language Processing algorithms that learn to interpret and respond to natural human speech patterns. In a menu-driven world, our devices aren’t listening to us, they are waiting for an input. That’s the quantum leap voice technology promises: For the first time in human history, machines can truly interact with us. But as we’ve seen, that’s not how people think voice technology works. Because we are so used to machines waiting for our commands, we’re not conscious that many of them are now listening to us go about our daily lives. Contrary to the image created by advertising of a fully conversational human-computer interface (a la the Star Trek “computer” or “J.A.R.V.I.S.” from Marvel’s Iron Man), if you try to hold a “conversation” today with Alexa, Cortana, Siri, or Google, you will be disappointed. Most people who use voice technology quickly learn its limitations and adjust their expectations. In fact, most people use Alexa-enabled devices to tell give them weather reports or to play on-demand music. But if voice technology is to improve, its developers need to listen to and analyze many more interactions. Their argument for listening is simple: As consumers get better at interacting with voice technology, the technology will learn and improve. Voice is a form of biometric data — something that is uniquely yours. Additionally, voice technology invades your privacy in an insidious way, always listening, always recording, and always learning more. Voice technology is the ultimate behavioral study that you didn’t realize was happening. As we’ve discussed, they need that data to improve their voice technology, and you’re willingly giving it to them. A response from Amazon: “We’ve built in multiple layers of privacy protections into Echo devices. By default, Echo devices are designed to detect only the wake word “Alexa.” The device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word. Customers can review voice recordings associated with their account and delete those voice recordings one by one or all at once in the Alexa app or at https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacy.” – Amazon Spokesperson About Jason Voiovich Jason’s arrival in marketing was doomed from birth. These days, instead of trying to invent novelty snack dispensers, Jason has dedicated his career to finding marketing’s north star, refocusing it on building healthy relationships between consumers and businesses, between patients and clinicians, and between citizens and organizations.

" Netflix just unlocked the first truly viral movie. Some of the most successful movies of all time did a large part of their business due to word-of-mouth. This isn’t something Netflix could have done even a few years ago. In the good old days, to see a “viral” movie, you had to hear about it, look up a showtime at a local theater, drive to said theater, buy a ticket to said movie, and sit through said movie in said theater. In this new era, you perhaps don’t even have to hear about said movie — again, maybe it’s just right there when you open the app — you simply sit through said movie in your living room.¹ Said another way: time, time, time, money, time has been compressed down to just time.² Talk about streamlined. In my case, I watched Bird Box because so many people were talking about it on Twitter. It was word-of-mouth, but not necessarily in the normal sense — again, the movie is decent, but not great and the chatter I saw was largely meme-based! It was clever because unlike so many other movie trailers shown during the event, the kicker was that you could watch the movie right now. First, you don’t even need to spend tens of millions of dollars to promote this type of movie. In fact, a simple in-app promotion likely reaches as many people as a Super Bowl ad — and it undoubtedly leads to much higher conversion! Second, for the virality to truly work, the movie has to be at least halfway decent. Last night, Bloomberg’s Eric Newcomer and I had a debate about whether or not Netflix runs the risk of a “boy who cried ‘wolf!’” situation if they keep doing these tactics with less-than-stellar movies. I agree that this is a risk, but far less of one than with movies in theaters. But again, if a movie isn’t loved (or at least talked about) by most people, the true virality won’t kick in. And, of course, it does ultimately behoove Netflix to only massively promote films they’re proud of, from a brand perspective.³ Then again, they have the data to know what their audience wants to watch (even if they say something different in public), and they can very granularly tailor such promotions to certain people based on such desires. Of this I’m certain: if Bird Box were released in theaters, relatively few people would have seen it. It was a longer, less clever version of A Quiet Place.⁴ The only reason it would have generated any business was the same reason it would have gotten made: Sandra Bullock.⁵ But on Netflix, her star power, mixed with the aforementioned reduction of friction and Netflix’s promotion led to a huge hit. ² I would argue ‘money’ is removed because you’re paying for Netflix anyway — though there are probably at least a few people who signed up for Netflix in order to watch Bird Box? ³ Though you could argue they wouldn’t make (or buy) a film they weren’t proud of in at least some capacity… ⁴ A movie which, you could certainly argue, did so well because of — wait for it — great word-of-mouth (great irony given the plot, to boot!) Which would undoubtedly be a Netflix movie these days.",TECHNOLOGY
" Major players in the cloud-computing space — AWS, IBM, and others — have successfully rolled out blockchain-based products. Blockchain, the technology that underpins crypto-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, allows for relatively secure distributed transaction logs that are difficult to forge. This kind of security is extremely useful in industries where products or items need to be tracked throughout their lifecycle, like packages, vital records, and identities. Being able to track a diamond from the moment it is unearthed in a diamond mine all the way to its final purchaser ensures that legitimate stones are not swapped for or stolen or illegitimate ones — aka, “blood diamonds” or “conflict diamonds” — allowing governments and merchants to ensure they are not trafficking in illicit goods. The rise of Kubernetes has been on the horizon for a long time now and its prominence was just about a foregone conclusion due to its backing and heritage (Google). Born out of Google’s Borg scheduler which it uses internally, Kubernetes is a “container-platform-in-a-box” designed for modularity. Recruiters are now looking for people with Kubernetes experience because it has become the de facto container runtime, with even AWS and Google Cloud now offering a managed Kubernetes service. Stop me if you’ve heard this before: new open-source virtual infrastructure platform gains massive popularity due to its hyper-scale ability, giving companies the ability to run their own internal virtual platforms. After years of sunk budgets, millions of developer hours contributing back to the project to fix its myriad issues, and the growing complexity of its demands, companies finally pull the plug on their efforts and move to more stable and sustainable platforms. Like OpenStack, Kubernetes’ modularity and scalability comes with a complexity and human-hours cost. Also, with Kubernetes having its first major vulnerability this year, its only a matter of time until security researchers find more. But that stability comes at a cost: the language maintainers have stated that it will stay rather static and they don’t plan on adding any of the niceties that make languages like Python easier to work with. Once again, security vulnerabilities continue to hang over our heads like so many boogiemen. From state-sponsored cyberwarfare compaigns to engineers being complete idiots, 2018 saw its fair share of security stories. Additionally, high-profile companies like Ticketfly, Orbitz, Delta, Sears/KMart, Macy’s, and Adidas all disclosed security breaches of their own — and that was all before the end of July. The Department of Homeland Security disclosed a breach in which 247,167 current and former DHS employees had their personally identifiable information stolen by a former DHS employee. And these are just the ones that we hear and know about; there are countless other breaches happening all the time that are either never found out, never disclosed, or never reported on. Part of the problem is that cybersecurity is trying to prove its value by proving a negative: good security is worth it because nothing happens, but does nothing happen because of the security or because no one targeted the company? Cybersecurity is not a young field, some of its core principles have been around since the inception of computing, but modern security engineers are tasked with understanding those principles but also understanding modern computing as it grows ever more complex. The net result is a corps of security engineers that either understand the principles and try to apply them to everything (“security by checkbox”) or that understand modern computing but don’t understand good security practice. Everyone from IBM to Jabra have jumped on board and are offering “AI-powered” products, some with more realistic claims than others. And that’s certainly part of the problem with the AI buzz: there’s a lot of snake oil out there from companies just trying to ride the hype. Personally, I take issue with the use of the term “AI” to describe anything that cannot pass an unscripted Turing test, but I digress from the larger point: that not every problem is a potential application for machine learning (what today’s “AI” really is). Machine learning doesn’t need to, and probably shouldn’t be, used to cancel out background noise on a pair of headphones when we can do that just fine as it is, nor should it probably manage our finances, yet we see these types of products popping up all over the place. Consumers are going to start realizing that the AI-powered TV remote they just shelled out an extra $50 a month for doesn’t help them change channels any better than their free one, or that maybe managing an old analog thermostat wasn’t that hard after all and they don’t need a wifi-enabled AI-powered IoT device that costs $300 do it for them.",TECHNOLOGY
" Still, I was surprised to see quite a few articles citing the lack of innovation on Apple’s part as the reason for the missed forecasts, or implying that raising the prices for iPhone X and XS was the wrong move on the company’s part. I believe both of those statements are incorrect, and, more importantly, arguing that the current slowdown is Apple’s fault (and thus could have been avoided by employing a different strategy on the company’s part), means missing the key point here — which is that what happened was simply inevitable, and there was absolutely nothing Apple could have done to prevent it from happening (well, aside from forecasting revenue growth less aggressively, of course). Going back to Apple, the first wasn’t really the option — the company historically has been producing premium hardware products, and going after the margins rather than the market share. Flagship devices from other manufacturers it competes against often cost only slightly less, and are instead chosen by the customers for reasons other than just the price — by reducing iPhone prices, Apple would have likely gained only a limited number of new users, and at the same time risked depressing its margins for the entire iPhone user base, leaving it worse off, not better, than before. And going after the lower-priced competitors would mean that Apple would have had to get in a different business altogether, having to compete in lower margin categories for the customers who were unwilling or unable to pay a price premium for Apple’s products. While it’s possible that Apple could have gained additional market share this way, it takes a completely different mindset to compete in this segment — one that Apple doesn’t have, and that goes against a lot of things that made Apple successful in the first place. So, if the Apple had no real way to grow its user base in the recent years, the only viable strategy it was left with was to raise prices to extract higher rents from its existing user base, which is exactly what it has done over the last few years. Arguably, the company’s financial performance last year proved that it was the right strategy too — despite the higher prices, it managed to sell the same number of iPhones as it did in 2016, proving that the customers were willing to pay the higher prices (the growth in the number of devices sold waned the year before that, making it hard to argue that, if not for the price increase, Apple would have sold more devices). As to what happened in 2018, it had nothing to do with the price hike — rather, with the maturing hardware and longer upgrade cycles, it was simply inevitable that at one point Apple would face a decline in sales no matter what it did. iPhone X might have been innovative enough to incentivize users to upgrade, but it’s arguably impossible to spit out large updates like that every year (which was also the reason for Apple’s 2-year product cycle in the first place, with the company releasing a significant update to the iPhone in one year, and then making iterative improvements upon it the next year). Finally, one might argue that instead of raising the prices, Apple could have kept them steady instead or even lowered them, in order to make it an easier for its current users to justify the more frequent upgrades to the new hardware. The issue with this logic goes back to the point made in the previous paragraph — with the maturation of the smartphones as a category, the users simply see no reason to upgrade as frequently as before, and keeping the prices at the same level or slightly lowering them wouldn’t magically create the need to do so. And on the contrary, with the longer upgrade cycles, a lot of Apple’s customers (who, arguably, weren’t particularly price sensitive to begin with) might have easier time swallowing the higher price tag, if it means getting a device they’d be happy with in the years to come. There are two reasons for that: first, Apple’s recent troubles are most definitely directly tied to the iPhone sales, so it seemed to make sense to focus on it; second, I’ve already expressed my opinion about the growth potential of other products Apple sells in my previous article, and simply had nothing to add to that.",TECHNOLOGY
" I bike commute a few times a month, but it’s a 1,000' climb on the way in, and kind of an awkward duration: too short for a proper workout, but just long/steep enough to ensure you show up covered in schvitz, having to change clothes and do the whole rigamarole upon arrival. Lately, my buddy won’t shut up about micromobility and ebikes, and last weekend something finally clicked for me: 4 mile trips, 3 mile trips, 2 mile trips are not a good fit for a car, truck or van. Then he asked me, point blank: “Is there a good reason you can’t just take an ebike to work?” I tried to visualize ebiking the 4 mile route to work. But after researching zillions of ebike options, I grew disappointed by the consistently lame designs, high cost and low motor power (usually 250w). There are a few different electrification options (like an in-wheel hub motor you can even get at WalMart), but the real deal is a “mid drive” kit, which basically sends tons of power to your chainring, propelling you either with pedal-assist, or a throttle on the handlebar. A little more research revealed that — shocker — a Chinese company makes a reliable, powerful and affordable 1000w mid drive motor (the Bafang “bottom bracket system heavy duty,” or BBSHD) that is tried and true, backed by countless testimonials. When I described my off-road commute, people with this motor laughed and told me I’d be able to get up insanely steep hills no problem. Lithium-ion is the battery of choice, and a 13.5ah battery reportedly propels you around 30 miles (see below for my actual field test results). I searched around, and found that Unruly sells a turnkey conversion of the same bike for $4,550 with solid battery and components, but only using the weaker 750w Bafang motor. Then we screwed in both the 68mm and 100mm version of the motor to dry fit two different options. It was hard to tell which one to use for a 73mm bottom bracket, but after studying both options screwed in, the 100mm had a better Q Factor (technically, the distance between the pedal attachment points on the crank arms, but practically, how far your feet are apart while pedaling), but required a ton of spacers to make work and worried us that it could loosen over time. The 68mm fit perfectly, but the left pedal was closer to the frame than the right pedal, and there was a noticeably smaller Q Factor. So we popped on an offset crank on the left side, which miraculously rendered perfect symmetry and Q Factor. The motor hangs (chainring side), and secures via bracket (left side) onto the black threaded piece screwed into the bottom bracket. The motor has two bolt holes that attach to the bracket on the left side, and you want the housing of the forward bolt hole to sit flush, metal on metal (allowing for a permanently tight fit with no compression), against the bottom of the down tube, as the motor is going to put a ton of pressure at that touchpoint. We then popped the cranks and pedals on, prepped a new chain to accommodate a 42-tooth instead of 30-tooth chainring (tip: to calculate the extra number of links you need, just subtract the old chainring teeth from the new one, and divide by 2; in our case, we added 6 links). Then we pulled out the rear derailleur cable, and chopped a 2-inch gap in the cable housing to make way for a “shift detector,” a somewhat controversial bell/whistle that turns off the motor for a microsecond while you shift gears, reducing wear/tear on your cassette according to some. It also makes it feel kind of like shifting gears in a motorcycle in a Metrosexual Sons of Anarchy kind of way. The connection point between the battery pack and the frame mount (which then connects to the motor and controls) used to be in the middle, limiting options for connecting the mounting plate to the frame. This one moves the connection point way to the bottom, so you have many more options for mounting a bike frame, all of which are different. The design is so new, however, that the dudes in China installed the charging inlet upside down, so we had to open up the battery pack and flip it over. Sadly, the options we had for connecting the mounting plate to the factory threaded holes were off by about 1/8 of an inch and we couldn’t access them. The factory rivet nuts were a bit taller than the new ones, so we ground them down a touch to ensure the battery mounting plate will set flush against the downtube. Since the wiring is one-size-fits-all (one of the only downsides I can think of to retrofitting vs buying a turnkey ebike), you have to get creative with scrunching up and ratcheting down the excess wiring. The whole setup flies in the face of minimalism: though clean and tight, there are wires zip tied everywhere, there’s a color display on the bars, and it takes two hands and a grimace to pick it up. I went for a more robust field test today, trying out two different commutes from my house to my office. I immediately biked home, and returned to the office taking what I’ve found to be the most direct bikeable route, which takes me about 25 minutes and burns about 300 calories on my gravel bike. The battery was close to dead when I got home, leaving me to question whether I could reliably get to/from San Francisco on a single charge. Time will tell, but I have to imagine that this experiment pushed the equipment pretty hard, and could see getting 30–40 miles on a lower setting with much less elevation gain. Overall, the ebike is strongly positioned to solve my 4 mile problem. It will get me to work and back using a few amp hours of electricity, which gives the commute a whole aura of lightness. Mutual smiles from other stoked bike commuters is always nice, and it just feels good to be outside.",TECHNOLOGY
" I bike commute a few times a month, but it’s a 1,000' climb on the way in, and kind of an awkward duration: too short for a proper workout, but just long/steep enough to ensure you show up covered in schvitz, having to change clothes and do the whole rigamarole upon arrival. Lately, my buddy won’t shut up about micromobility and ebikes, and last weekend something finally clicked for me: 4 mile trips, 3 mile trips, 2 mile trips are not a good fit for a car, truck or van. Then he asked me, point blank: “Is there a good reason you can’t just take an ebike to work?” I tried to visualize ebiking the 4 mile route to work. But after researching zillions of ebike options, I grew disappointed by the consistently lame designs, high cost and low motor power (usually 250w). There are a few different electrification options (like an in-wheel hub motor you can even get at WalMart), but the real deal is a “mid drive” kit, which basically sends tons of power to your chainring, propelling you either with pedal-assist, or a throttle on the handlebar. A little more research revealed that — shocker — a Chinese company makes a reliable, powerful and affordable 1000w mid drive motor (the Bafang “bottom bracket system heavy duty,” or BBSHD) that is tried and true, backed by countless testimonials. When I described my off-road commute, people with this motor laughed and told me I’d be able to get up insanely steep hills no problem. Lithium-ion is the battery of choice, and a 13.5ah battery reportedly propels you around 30 miles (see below for my actual field test results). I searched around, and found that Unruly sells a turnkey conversion of the same bike for $4,550 with solid battery and components, but only using the weaker 750w Bafang motor. Then we screwed in both the 68mm and 100mm version of the motor to dry fit two different options. It was hard to tell which one to use for a 73mm bottom bracket, but after studying both options screwed in, the 100mm had a better Q Factor (technically, the distance between the pedal attachment points on the crank arms, but practically, how far your feet are apart while pedaling), but required a ton of spacers to make work and worried us that it could loosen over time. The 68mm fit perfectly, but the left pedal was closer to the frame than the right pedal, and there was a noticeably smaller Q Factor. So we popped on an offset crank on the left side, which miraculously rendered perfect symmetry and Q Factor. The motor hangs (chainring side), and secures via bracket (left side) onto the black threaded piece screwed into the bottom bracket.

" Simple Health, Hims, Ro, Nurx, and Thirty Madison, shifting generic drug prescribing, delivery, and user experience to a full-stack model more akin to San Francisco direct-to-consumer (D2C) startups than traditional East Coast biopharma giants. Depending on the company, from within a couple hours to ten days, a physician will evaluate the forms and approve the customer for the drug in question, which is then shipped directly to the customer as either a one-time purchase or a subscription. A swath of chronic diseases, including diabetes, congestive heart failure, and rheumatoid arthritis, desperately need an integrated, end-to-end solution that seamlessly integrates pharmaceuticals, software, and support services in a single package. The latter is where the tech industry could strike first, and in the case of digital therapeutics companies like Pear and Akili, might already have the upper hand. We’re seeing a new economy of consumers willing to pay a premium — often via cash due to the rise of high-deductible health plans rather than more comprehensive insurance products — for specific health care services. Notably, the beachhead for these companies is a combination of appealing to vanity and reducing stigma (the result is very Thorstein Veblen but the method is anything but), which happen to be addressed by convenient access to cash-pay drugs like Viagra and Propecia. The TAM here is larger than expected, and will continue to grow as the biopharma industry deals with a patent cliff for many of the industry’s blockbusters over the next five years. Ever since the 21st Century Cures Act redefined how software for medicine was regulated and the development of the Pre-Cert program for digital health, the FDA has been speeding up drug approvals, clearing software bringing machine learning to medicine, and devising regulation to adapt to the health care consumer environment and technology landscape. Bloomberg reports that within the first half of 2019, the FDA plans to release guidance that would limit the need for people to visit a physician in-person to determine their need for a prescription or over-the-counter drug. As evidenced above, a non-trivial fraction of the next-generation of health care consumers prizes convenience over price, and as the on-demand economy becomes more pervasive and consumers hold health care services to the same expectations as they do to Doordash, that fraction is likely to grow. At the moment, companies will monitor patient behavior on online communities like PatientsLikeMe, reach out via non-profit research organizations and fundraisers like Tour De Cure, meet with physicians to better understand what drives patient decisionmaking regarding adherence and treatment selection, and throw advertising data at freshly hired data scientists to adjust their content as needed. The idea of bringing together the access and convenience of D2C drug companies, digital therapeutics that use software and sensors to guide and change behavior, and traditional pharmaceuticals as end-to-end solutions for chronic disease could tackle multiple elements of biopharma’s market challenges: Some early examples of this model have already reached patients. The Proteus ‘chip on a pill’ linked to Diovan, an antihypertensive drug, helps patients at Rush Medical Center in Chicago both remember to take their medication and tracks biomarkers and vitals such as heart rate to help clinicians monitor patients between visits. More recently, Pear Therapeutics partnered with Novartis, the Swiss pharma giant, to combine Pear’s neuromodulatory software with Novartis drugs for schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. The next generation of pharma portfolios will include end-to-end products that consist of partnerships between traditional drug pipeline assets and the best of a burgeoning number of startups tackling access, convenience, and long-term efficacy of therapeutics. The bigger challenge here might not be the technology or partnerships needed to build these full-stack products, but perhaps instead the managerial foresight — and potentially disruptive operating changes — that will need to happen to help nudge an industry largely (and rightly) laser-focused on biochemical assets towards what we can do with silicon.",TECHNOLOGY
" The whole experience is designed to show off Leap’s interaction code, and it has you floating around in some sort of space station, just poking, grabbing, and batting at various objects. I’d used the Leap Motion device before in desktop mode and while seeing your virtual hands move on the screen when you wave them above the camera was great fun, it was nothing compared to the effect of the same process but in VR. To this day, my favourite VR games are at least partially set in zero-gravity environments (Lone Echo, Detached etc.). This means that when I’m browsing through the latest releases in the VR section of Steam, everything with a space theme gets a good looking over. In no particular order, these are: Lone Echo (and Arena/Combat, although I haven’t bought Combat), ADR1FT, Detached, Star Shelter, and the one I want to write about today, Downward Spiral: Horus Station by 3rd Eye Studios. Back in April 2018, I downloaded Downward Spiral: Prologue, the demo that preceded Horus Station. I’d already played through Lone Echo three times, and completed ADR1FT and Detached, so I was looking out for something to scratch this particular itch. It had similar push/pull locomotion to Lone Echo (but understandably without Lone Echo’s astounding inverse kinematics on the hands), and a magnetic grapple winch for traversing large areas. In a VR space game, you’re going to spend a lot of time with your suit gloves in view, so they rather do need to look the part. I don’t want to waffle on about the demo too much though, because a couple of months later Downward Spiral: Horus Station was released. Inevitably, I’m going to be comparing Horus Station to the other similar titles that I’ve played. Downward Spiral: Horus Station is a *lonely* game. In comparison to Lone Echo, Detached, even something like Red Matter if we step outside the zero-g requirement for a moment, Horus Station seems to have nobody to talk to, listen to, or even that much to read. This ultra-light method of exposition leaves the player to deduce much of what’s actually going on from the set pieces, the state of the station, and ambient audio. I spent a few minutes last night consciously focusing on the sound, and I heard blips and beeps, clicks and thunks, hums and throbs, electrical zaps and crackles, the whole station felt alive with beautifully crafted audio. The station itself has a distinctly retro theme, with CRT monitors embedded in the terminals, and the kind of cushioned wall panels seen in films like Alien. You get to a certain spot, the screen fades to black, the music comes up, and some 8–10 seconds later you get the Downward Spiral logo and “End of Act” text coming up centre screen.You’re given the option to continue or return to the main menu, which made me wonder at what point my progress was actually being saved. I had a fear that you had to finish a whole act to save your progress, but I also found that I’d load up in the last room I entered, so that was unfounded (I think… I’m still not 100% sure, and I did manage to lose all my progress just after act two first time around, so heaven knows). Save issues aside, that delay between ending an act and the menu coming up seemed enormous, especially since the music was playing throughout, so it wasn’t as if it had hung or something. Every few rooms you come across a door that when you pull the handle, the game is clearly loading up a new area because the whole thing grinds to a near halt. What I personally feel lets it down though, is something that was probably done to protect players that haven’t seen this sort of thing before. It seems like the player avatar has a larger collision volume that is designed specifically to gradually slow you down as you approach a wall, door, or anything else you might be able to grab. While I’m on the subject of bumping things, I found it slightly awkward, but also really clever, that the tools in your hands interacted with each other. Working like a handheld compressor with the outlet ports situated round the back of the barrel, this thing can be charged to different propulsion levels for slow, mid, and high speed bursts. A high speed burst is fast enough to evade most enemies, but it takes a good couple of seconds to charge up, so you need to think ahead. I couldn’t say if I was just being bad at the combat or if there actually was something up with the spatialisation, but it was pretty irksome either way. Thankfully, all the combat zones have respawn points either within or just outside, so it never takes long to get back into the fray. In conclusion, aside from a couple of technical hiccups, and ignoring the long range bumpers on the avatar, Downward Spiral: Horus Station was loads of fun and exactly what I was after to fill the gap while waiting for Lone Echo 2. If you like zero-g VR games as much as I do, you really do need to have Horus Station in your library.",TECHNOLOGY
"  In the last couple of years Apple’s prices haves started creeping up and it’s a concern. I was first introduced to an Apple product at the tender age of 16, I was at college and ever since then have owned pretty much every product they have released. Whether I am at work, at home, abroad or anywhere else, there’s always one of my Apple devices within reach. Apple were churning out new innovative products like nobody’s business. The debate as to whether Apple would be the same as it is today if he were still alive, is one no one can answer. However, there is one thing that can’t be argued and that is Steve Jobs brought Apple back from the brink of bankruptcy when he returned in 1997. When he and Steve Wozniak co-founded Apple, Jobs managed to take a startup from his parents garage to a Fortune 500 company. For a number of years after his passing, Apple would be fine, there would still be plenty of products in the pipeline that had Jobs written all over them. However, in the last couple of years, it’s clear to see that Apple is struggling a bit, the Steve Jobs pipeline has dried up. There’s now more fragmentation in the product line up, pro devices are non existent and very little has come out in terms of revolutionary products in the last couple of years. I’ll let you make your own decision on that but from my viewpoint, I believe Steve Jobs was critical to Apple and they are struggling without such greatness in the company. The price creeping of Apple products over the last few years is worrying. I’ve read many forums over the last few years and even more so in 2018 of many people complaining at the price hikes of Apple products. To compare a couple of receipts I have found from Apple in my email, here’s a price comparison on a few products:iPhone 6 64GB Space Grey, Unlocked: £619 (Purchased 2014)iPhone X 256GB Silver, Unlocked: £1,149 (Purchased 2017) MacBook Pro 15.4/2.5GHZ/16GB/512GB: £1,999 (Purchased Aug 2014)MacBook Pro 15.4/2.6GHZ/16GB/512GB: £2,699 (Purchased Sep 2018) iPad WiFi 64GB Silver: £599 (Purchased Nov 2013)iPad Pro Wifi 64GB Silver: £769 (Purchased Nov 2018) As you can see, the products I have replaced are mostly like for like. Yes there’s some more flash storage on the iPhone X I bought and I have a slightly faster processor in my upgraded MacBook Pro but however you want to dress it up, there’s some significant price increases there. Apple’s competitors are watching on closely, they can see what’s happening and finally feel as though Apple’s reign is slowly coming to an end. Just last week, Tim Cook sent out an email to invite Apple employees to an ‘All-Hands Meeting’ to address concerns over Q1 earnings forecast. With the recent price increases, I believe Apple is starting to price consumers out the market. Irrespective of whether they are better or not, the average consumer doesn’t care when they see they can get a similar device for up-to half the cost of an Apple equivalent. Apple products have never been cheap and have always been more expensive than the competition but they have started to increase the gap so much that their sales are starting to suffer. Apple isn’t going anywhere any time soon but this has been coming for a while now and unless it’s nipped in the bud it will only get worse. Apple knows how to make great products, they have awesome marketing and on their day, can still make the competition look like start-ups. I’m no CEO and it takes a strong character to run a company the size of Apple but I wish Tim Cook would take a step back from all the noise, think about what Apple has achieved in the past and why they achieved it. Get back to the basics, reduce the product line, get some Pro products out the door and focus on what they always did best….making great, innovative products at sensible prices. From a totally selfish point of view, I really hope Apple can pull it together in 2019 because I love my Apple products and having used competitor products in the past, I’d hate to switch. Come on Mr Cook, get Apple back to the company we all know and love.",TECHNOLOGY
" In fact the website of Smart Energy GB, the industry body tasked with coordinating the roll out of smart electricity & gas meters in the UK, has in the past made exciting claims like: While it’s not explicit, the underlying assumption is that people with smart meters will be able to closely monitor their energy consumption through in-home displays. Even official research conducted by Smart Energy GB found that out of all the people they surveyed who’ve had a smart meter for a year, only half think that they’ve made any savings at all. My colleague Jack has already written about using the AIDA framework to think about persuasive design, so let’s try to apply it to the context of Smart Meters: The in-home display is the visible component of a smart meter which will in theory get you to pay attention to your energy consumption. However, there are also a lot of reasons why this might not work: Once a smart meter owner starts paying attention to what’s shown in their display, will they be engaged enough that they’ll want to spend some time to understand what’s happening in more detail? Smart meters displays stick to showing you the pure facts about your energy consumption, usually on a small screen with limited interactivity. But let’s assume that you’ve stayed interested and kept monitoring your energy consumption regularly through your smart meter — would that help build the desire to save? This is where smart meter designers did actually make one good choice — it’s possible to view your consumption in monetary terms, not just in terms of the amount of electricity or gas consumed. However, because of the limited user interface it might be hard to get a smart meter display into the right mode to see your consumption in monetary terms, and even harder to switch into viewing your monthly or even yearly consumption. And whilst an indiction of past or current consumption is useful, people would also like to know how much they’d end up paying in a month or a year if they continue consuming energy at a similar rate — something that many smart meters don’t offer at all. A committed smart meter user, regularly monitoring their consumption, discovering that they’d spent £5 more on this week than the last one, and wanting to take action, wouldn’t know where to start. Unfortunately a smart meter only measures the total consumption of everything in your household, and has no way of telling you where exactly you could save, or what the effect of your efforts has been so far. Ultimately, a smart meter only shows you a general view of the energy you’ve spent after you’ve spent it, not before, so there’s little chance of changing behaviour. However, internet connected home appliances might just hold the key to saving energy, doing more than smart meters. But showing you what you consume in context, when you’re already engaged and have the means to act, will help you save more money than a smart meter display gathering dust in a corner of your hallway.",TECHNOLOGY
"  Since I posted about Amazon’s new Go store in downtown SF, I’ve had a lot of spirited discussions about whether it is using AI or not, how it’s done, and whether we’ve foolishly traded cashiers for Skynet. Before we get started… I have worked with Amazon Deep Learning (DL) Engineers, I know Amazon DL Engineers, Amazon DL Engineers are friends of mine, and I am no Amazon DL Engineer… They are much more clever than I am, and probably have an infinitely cooler way of doing this. This means dozens of cameras in the store, watching everything going on. The most important design criteria is that Amazon gets to control and meticulously document each and everything going into the Go store, including the people. Even the bags they offer in the store are a high contrast orange, which would allow them to highly accurately identify the bag which would boost several signals. They might even be able to get away with using a form of boosted scale invariant template matching (template matching) instead of fully convolutional neural networks (CNN), though they probably still use CNNs. I’d guess that Amazon has a planning system that helps them design the layout of the store so that items in which they can’t control the label are placed orthogonally and where they can control the label, they automatically design one that is highly orthogonal. This would all be packaged into a sophisticated image registration system, for every product that is sold in a Go store. Imagine how accurate a CNN would be if you could take multiple pictures with varying entropy of every single item that the object detector would need to find, and train it exclusively on those images, with an integrated ablation study for augmentation. I’d bet that Amazon has a rig that takes a 3-dimensional image of the item, augments it nine ways from Sunday, and then trains the model from this engineered and augmented dataset. With this highly optimized dataset, you could use a You Only Look Once (YOLO) type model (Yolo) and address the SKU tracking problem handily. Amazon has confirmed that they aren’t using Facial Recognition in the Go store. Amazon has a Go app, that you open before entering the store, and displays a barcode. Amazon is able to exactly control where you are and how you walk into the store. That was a decade ago, to understand what state of the art is in pose estimation take a look at CMU’s work. Or go deep with Facebook’s DensePose If you want to really freak yourself out, check out these real-time experiments based on Google’s PoseNet, Move Mirror and Tracking Demo Accurate pose estimation opens up a world of possibilities. It’s a cakewalk to track a unique user around a store (remember they control store layout and camera position, no blind spots), but even more importantly they can use the actual poses themselves to boost the accuracy of the SKU tracking. If you were to take something off the shelf they could analyze the video feed from 5 seconds before and 5 seconds after, cross reference that with know stock levels, and make an even more accurate decision on what was pulled off the shelf. Combining control of the environment, a sophisticated image registration system, object detection and pose estimation allows them to deliver a truly magical experience. It would undoubtedly have been easier to solve this problem using a combination of smart shelves, RFID, scales, etc… It’s often more interesting to know how people didn’t do something, than how they did. Amazon knows that if they were building the stores, yes they could control all aspects of the design and use these easier solutions. Using Go as a lab they’re creating Amazon Marketplace for third-party physical retailers. The chances of the retailer selling something that Amazon doesn’t have pictures of is low, so image registration could be bootstrapped. Or maybe Amazon I’m wrong and Go stores are just there to sell more Red Bull.",TECHNOLOGY
"  I guess we could potentially connect most devices to the internet, hence the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT). Of course, it still requires manually emptying followed by use of a weight reset option, to bring internet and cat waste worlds into calibration again. !” Connecting things to the internet that require your physical presence on a regular basis in order for them to be useful seems a little preposterous to me: Kettles, coffee machines, cat litter trays… the list seems to be growing. I often wonder with those coffee machines how regularly the owner discovers that it needs refilling or a mug placing under it — things that need you to physically attend to it — before you can use your smartphone to remotely tell it to create the drink… that requires you to collect it in-person anyway. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got a few IoT devices: Notably, a smart plug which I use to turn a lamp on and off to a set schedule, for security reasons. So that got me thinking about a whole class of home devices that have appalling UIs, which could be given a far superior user experience via a smartphone. These are the hardware devices for which the manufacturer didn’t want to invest in the extra button, another LED, the larger LCD, the complex controller to support a better UI, etc… I sometimes suspect they decided not to involve any user experience expertise at all! We’ve all got these devices… the ones with user manuals that painstakingly describe holding down one poorly-labelled button whilst waiting for some bizarre sign from the device that it has changed “mode” so that you can now do something slightly different to it via the same poorly-labelled buttons. Sadly, our homes still seem to be filled with these devices, from boilers to fridges to microwaves, all limited in terms of the user experience they offer because the manufacturer was constrained by budget or ingenuity. In my own home, the most egregious crime against UIs was committed by the manufacturer of a small device which controls my water heater (pictured here). Its innocent and simplistic appearance hides a more complex story: It is situated right next to the water heater (seems logical), roughly 10 inches from the floor (less logical for adult humans), on a wall in a darkened cupboard (with no light) at a distance from the heater that requires you to wedge your head between the heater and the device. Needless to say, without a manual (I tried and failed to find one online) inferring what the controls (4 poorly-labelled buttons and several “modes”) do whilst balancing in this precarious position took some trial and error. This is the kind of machine that I could maybe set going via the existing controls but might want to see more status and notifications about via a better smartphone UI. For devices that live in our homes, which we predominantly use when we are there, do we really need to “internet enable” them to benefit from a better UI? If all of the intelligence, apart from the UI, resides on the device itself, there must be a better way to connect to it, particularly when we have a growing number of such devices in our homes? I’m talking about the devices I am happy to be standing right next to, with my smartphone in-hand, controlling them via an improved UI. Shouldn’t connecting these devices via our home wi-fi be enough to authorise a smartphone connected via the same wi-fi to talk to the device? Is there a better way to see that my smartphone is authorised to use the wi-fi and should, therefore, be able to control the devices in the apartment? It could also be another use case for Bluetooth… though I already find that particular technology flakier and flakier the more devices I connect. SIMPLER UI, BUT COMPLEX TO CONNECT Beyond the question of needing the internet at all, my smart plug involved a complex process to pair it with my phone and to introduce it to the home wi-fi router. BETTER HOME DEVICE EXPERIENCES However we tackle these hurdles, it all seems a great opportunity to piggyback on the IoT momentum and to apply UI and UX advances to the many devices in our homes that were robbed of a good way for us to interact with them. Manufacturers might suddenly feel inclined to add new features for which an on-device UI would be cumbersome, but which a smartphone UI could easily control: A fridge manufacturer might be encouraged to report the internal temperature and defrost status of the device.",TECHNOLOGY
" Once was in my local barber shop that didn’t take cards (forcing me to go to the shop across the road, get cashback and return to the barber) and the other time was to pay the admission to the Tokyo State Guest House, which very surprisingly, was cash-only. On a recent trip to London, it was very noticeable how prevalent “cashless” has become there in just the last few months — multiple cafes with signs in the window declaring that cash is no longer accepted. Even Christmas markets are replete with signs of “card payments welcome” as handheld devices from iZettle, SumUp and Square have been adopted by individual traders to accept cards and contactless. But expect to see an ever-increasing range of pay-enabled devices as we move beyond contactless debit cards and Google/Apple Pay equipped phones and watches. For businesses, there are myriad benefits to cashless — no risk of hold ups, no cash counting after closing, no leakage from the till, no trips to the bank, no fraudulent notes to check, improved hygiene (cash is very dirty) and of course, faster transactions. While these positive stories are the reasons that businesses may argue for going cashless, there is also the so-called “credit card effect”, where people are more willing to spend when they aren’t handing over cash. Cash has served us well for over 2,500 years but talk of its demise at the hands of apps, plastic and contactless payments isn’t universally welcome. A recent BBC article highlighted some of the drawbacks of the move away from cash — such as the tendency for charity donations and payments to some sectors such as cleaners or childminders to be largely cash-based. Some States in the US are attempting to block businesses from going cashless, citing the impact on poorer communities. While I sympathise with the groups who could be marginalised by too rapid a move to cashless, I would urge authorities to find solutions rather than hold back progress and forgo the benefits. But the current haphazard move to cashless at the whim of individual businesses is not in the public interest. Governments, not financial institutions who stand to benefit in any event, should be leading the planning and timetable for the move to cashless — we should not force the vulnerable or elderly but should respect their attachment to cash, to the simple tangibility of notes and coins.

But arguably the field that has seen the biggest impact of motion design has been that of user experience (UX). But this idea was being challenged constantly with many designers trying to build in motion design in application interfaces. The most primitive ways in which this was done was to have lights within interfaces blink red and green to indicate things like the computer is connected to the Internet or the user is logged in or other such states of the application. One of the big shifts in user interface design came when the WWDC published the specifications for HTML 5 and CSS 3 (two technologies essential to making the World Wide Web what it is today) in 2014. Digital user interfaces clearly went from being offshoots of the print design world to occupy a pure-digital world where motion became an integral part of the framework. But with motion design, we can keep the button small and sleek but just make it fade in ahead of all the other elements on the page so it becomes the first element that catches the user’s attention. From arrows gliding around a screen pointing you to various screen elements, subtler motion design can help guide a user through an application. Previously, applications could also use motion design to make them appear faster than they actually are. After development tools started providing methods to integrate motion design into web applications, interfaces on mobile and desktop applications quickly followed suit and began offering options for motion design within their development platforms. Tools like Adobe’s After Effects are used to help create motion graphics, whereas those like Framer are used to create in-page animations and also page transitions. But the field is far from conquered yet and new tools are being released everyday that try to make the task of creating motion design simpler. Principle is a frequently used alternative to Framer that doesn’t produce the code behind the animation but is simpler to create animation and transitions with and is useful to designers in being able to communicate their ideas to developers so they can programme them into the applications when building them. Once you use motion design within the interface of your applications, it will be very tempting to use it everywhere. Motion design trends follow closely with those in graphic design but also have unique ones that have sprung up from within the field itself. Seamless Transitions — This style of motion design morphs one object into another seamlessly, producing very interesting visual effects that support linear storytelling techniques. Just as SFX adds a distinct flavour and personality and has become an essential device in filmmaking, motion design has become indispensable to application design today. With user experience design becoming more and more widespread and crucial in the world of software, motion design is one of those skills that is going to become very important as well.",TECHNOLOGY
" Since the IoT is becoming not only a technical but also a social phenomenon, changing our perception of devices around us and the environment we live in, the top trends we selected also represent both the machine and the human worlds. Data is the fuel of the IoT and, above all, the key to companies to make good decisions about products, services, employees, strategy, etc. Though clouds will continue to be a hot topic in the next year, the shift from centralized and cloud to edge architectures will only intensify in the IoT space in the near future. Part of the data is stored locally next to the IoT device that makes it readily available when needed so that the traffic on the network is reduced and bandwidth costs are minimized. It is a simulation tool that works with AI, machine learning, and the IoT to improve businesses’ experience by streamlining digital data operations. 5G, the forthcoming generation of low earth orbit satellites and backscatter networks is likely to gain attention at the IoT market optimizing power consumption, bandwidth, latency, connection density, operating cost, quality of service and range. The sensor market will also evolve continuously with new special-purpose sensors covering more situations and events and reducing power consumption required to run deep neural networks which in it turn will enable new edge architectures and use of DNN functions in low-power IoT endpoint devices. Speaking of the GDPR, we have to say that as the IoT expands, the need for a governance framework that ensures appropriate behavior in the data creation, storage, use and deletion is becoming increasingly important. Governance of the IoT-related projects will range from simple device audits and firmware updates to complex issues such as the control of devices and the strategic usage of the data they generate. In future, the IoT user experience (UX) will be driven by four factors: new sensors, new algorithms, new experience architectures and context, and socially aware experiences.",TECHNOLOGY
" A 2018 study investigating the neurological basis of anxiety in the brain has identified ‘anxiety cells’ located in the hippocampus — which not only regulate anxious behaviour but can be controlled by a beam of light. The findings, so far demonstrated in experiments with lab mice, could offer a ray of hope for the millions of people worldwide who experience anxiety disorders (including almost one in five adults in the US), by leading to new drugs that silence these anxiety-controlling neurons. “We wanted to understand where the emotional information that goes into the feeling of anxiety is encoded within the brain,” says one of the researchers, neuroscientist Mazen Kheirbek from the University of California, San Francisco. To find out, the team used a technique called calcium imaging, inserting miniature microscopes into the brains of lab mice to record the activity of cells in the hippocampus as the animals made their way around their enclosures. The team built special mazes where some paths led to open spaces and elevated platforms — exposed environments known to induce anxiety in mice, due to increased vulnerability to predators. Away from the safety of walls, something went off in the mice’s heads — with the researchers observing cells in a part of the hippocampus called ventral CA1 (vCA1) firing up, and the more anxious the mice behaved, the greater the neuron activity became. “We call these anxiety cells because they only fire when the animals are in places that are innately frightening to them,” explains senior researcher Rene Hen from Columbia University. Because this same regulation process operates in people, too — not just lab mice exposed to anxiety-inducing labyrinths — the researchers hypothesise that the anxiety neurons themselves could be a part of human biology, too. “Now that we’ve found these cells in the hippocampus, it opens up new areas for exploring treatment ideas that we didn’t know existed before,” says one of the team, Jessica Jimenez from Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons. Even more exciting is that we’ve already figured out a way of controlling these anxiety cells — in mice at least — to the extent it actually changes the animals’ observable behaviour. Using a technique called optogenetics to shine a beam of light onto the cells in the vCA1 region, the researchers were able to effectively silence the anxiety cells and prompt confident, anxiety-free activity in the mice. By changing the light settings, the researchers were also able to enhance the activity of the anxiety cells, making the animals quiver even when safely ensconced in enclosed, walled surroundings — not that the team necessarily thinks vCA1 is the only brain region involved here. “These cells are probably just one part of an extended circuit by which the animal learns about anxiety-related information,” Kheirbek told NPR, highlighting other neural cells justify additional study too. In any case, the next steps will be to find out whether the same control switch is what regulates human anxiety — and based on what we know about the brain similarities with mice, it seems plausible.",SCIENCE
"  Albert Einstein’s 1905 paper “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies” introduced — — “Time cannot be absolutely defined and there is an inseparable relation between time and signal velocity”.Under this new theory, the only means to define time is in reference to a definite system of linked, coordinated, and synchronized clocks. We need to synchronize our commitments and activities with measures both reliable from error and secure from strategic tampering — — with the spread of technologies to both independently measure the time and to broadcast a standard version of the time. The town’s so full of these confounded(confused) dials!”Time synchronizing also let the idler’s peers know just how much of their day they sacrificed while he naped. It wasn’t until about 750 that bells were rung at specific times of the day. All rely on the skill of the bell ringers ability to vary their own bell speed at the same time recognising the position of all the bells around them and recalling from memory a pattern of bells. GPS and Time: Global Positioning System(GPS) consists of 24 satellites and a ground station. It is known that the GPS system can calculate the precise position on the earth surface and it is finding ways into any industries to everyone. Most people feel the passage of time through sun rising and set every day in life. If GPS system were an advanced telescope the US military sent into outer space, the ‘atomic clock’ equipped on each satellite would be a powerful mechanism that enables people to acquire the accurate oscillation frequency of earth’s rotation period. Thus, GPS receiver can analyze very precious time data from GPS signals and these time data now has been distributed into various areas in the world. Synchronizing time through GPS system is difficult to understand as it involves in mathematics, physics and astronomy. In this system, only after obtaining precise time, people could measure the valid distant from a satellite. It is showed below (Bajaj, 2002, page92–94): (1) “triangulating” position from satellite: GPS system can track user’s present position by calculating distant from 3 satellites. (2) to finish step (1), GPS needs to measures radius(distance) using travel time of signals data. (3) to finish step (2), GPS needs to acquire precise time which sometimes are tiny numbers. (4) every GPS receiver needs to make correlation because any signals will delay during travelling through the atmosphere, such as “Error Modeling” offset correlation. After time recognized by a master clock or GPS module, it will be transmitted into time server and synchronized by any necessary fields in daily life. satellite signals: GPS system actually sends a sequence of data to thousands of receivers on earth through radio signals. According to Mauro proved that the most fundamental part of GPS radio signals is the ‘Pseudo Random Code’, which is composed of a sequence of code “0” and “1”.When I learned about this form of signals, it reminded me of historical “radiotelegraph secret”, which was packaged in the same method. For example, although each satellite has ubiquitous Pseudo-Random Code, which complexity guarantees GPS receiver cannot accidentally absorb in another GPS signals, all the satellites still use same frequency regular frequency without interfering with each other.",SCIENCE
"  Whether you are giving gifts to others or to yourself this holiday season, this list of the best popular science books of 2018 about astronomy, physics and mathematics is a great place to start reading and gifting by GrrlScientist for Forbes | @GrrlScientist Whilst I’ve researched and mini-reviewed this year’s list of popular science books, I’ve once again been impressed with the overall quality and variety of popular science books about physics published in 2018, in particular. Although I’m not a physicist, I’ve discovered that popular science books about physics are my favorites this year, and I think they’ll be your favorites, too. Losing the Nobel Prize: A Story of Cosmology, Ambition, and the Perils of Science’s Highest Honor by Brian Keating (W. W. Norton & Company, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) Cosmologist Brian Keating has written an interesting account about his part in the race for a Nobel Prize in physics. In this book, Professor Keating describes his involvement in the BICEP2 experiment and his personal ambitions of winning a Nobel Prize whilst also detailing his views of what is wrong with the Nobel Prize — particularly its limitation to just three living scientists (this is an unjust situation where nearly all researchers in a large team who contributed to a particular discovery are completely overlooked. Professor Keating delivers a clearly written synopsis of observational cosmology combined with an honest and informative assessment of the harsh realities of how the competitive world of astronomy and physics — and science in general — really work. This entertaining, moving and often witty book is one of my absolute favorites in this year’s impressive crop of popular science books. Lost in Math by Sabine Hossenfelder (Basic Books, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) Why has there not been a major breakthrough in fundamental physics for more than 40 years? Another of my favorites from this year’s group of popular science books, this thought-provoking and readable book is honest and often quite funny, and will be enjoyed by any scientifically curious person, as well as by physicists and by those who enjoy reading about the philosophy of science. Through Two Doors at Once: The Elegant Experiment That Captures the Enigma of Our Quantum Reality by Anil Ananthaswamy (Dutton, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) Thomas Young’s 200 year old “double slit” experiment still fascinates and mystifies scientists as well as nonspecialists because it shows how weird and counterintuitive reality can be at the smallest of scales. This clearly-written book also explores the many questions that the famous double slit experiment raises: What is the real “measurement problem”? A fascinating and readable exploration of quantum mechanics that is a particularly wonderful book for nonspecialists, hobbyists and students of science — you may not be able to put this captivating book down until you’ve finished it! Chasing New Horizons: Inside the Epic First Mission to Pluto by Alan Stern and David Grinspoon (Picador, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) If you like reading stories about underdogs who overcome all odds to achieve a particular goal, then this riveting true story is for you. The scientists and engineers were busy solving last-minute logistical problems — for example, they discovered Pluto has two moons only after New Horizons was well on its way, which raised all sorts of challenges for the team as they worked to prevent their probe from crashing whilst also gathering data on each moon. Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man’s First Journey to the Moon by Robert Kurson (Random House, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) This non-fiction page-turner reads like a novel, complete with plot twists and on-the-edge-of-your-seat anxiety, with historical context skilfully interwoven into the personal stories of three men who orbited the Moon, astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders, and their wives and children. The Space Barons: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the Quest to Colonize the Cosmos by Christian Davenport (PublicAffairs, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) Since the Moon missions ended ages ago, what does the future hold for space exploration? This provocative book is based upon years of meticulous research and exclusive interviews with all four of these billionaires, whom the author had direct access to during the writing of this book. Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the Fate of the Earth by Adam Frank (W. W. Norton & Company, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) Is there life on other planets? This impassioned book investigates the (relatively) new science of astrobiology, a discipline that explores new realities and new possibilities, and reveals universal truths about life and the planets it arises on. The author, astrophysicist Adam Frank, relies on elegant prose and conversational writing to make modern science comprehensible and illuminating for the nonspecialist as he explores important questions, such as how intelligent life could evolve and why we have never detected any sign or signal confirming that we are not alone in the universe. Throughout this profoundly important book, the author makes compelling arguments that not only is it likely that alien civilisations have existed many times before and concludes that many have driven their own worlds into their own Anthropocene, which leads to the most important question of all: what can those alien civilizations tell us about our own fate? The Atom: A Visual Tour by Jack Challoner (The MIT Press, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) The Atom is an engaging and visually appealing overview of physics and chemistry, as well as the history of our thinking about atoms and their structure: how atomic interactions create the properties of everyday materials; and what subatomic particles and their quantum world show us about the nature of reality in the larger world that we occupy. Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking (Bantam Books, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) Unless celebrated cosmologist Stephen Hawking somehow manages to come back from the dead, this is his final book — his final communication to humanity. Many of these are a rehash from his previous books, so a devoted fan who has read his entire oeuvre may be disappointed because there is little here that is truly new, although I was delighted by Professor Hawking’s humorous digs at the Trump crime clan. The Dialogues: Conversations About the Nature of the Universe by Clifford V. Johnson (The MIT Press, 2018: Amazon US / Amazon UK) Have you ever read a graphic novel about any scientific discipline? If not, then you’re in for a treat with this oversized book because it uses the graphic novel form to share a number of discussions about the nature of the universe — a fundamental series of conversations that, I suspect, will never grow old. Written and illustrated with full-color cartoons by the author, physicist Clifford Johnson, this book invites us to eavesdrop on a series of nine conversations about a variety of topics taking place in coffee shops, in trains, and in museums. Especially in view of the white male-dominated culture of physics, I was particularly pleased to see the inclusivity of characters — both men and women can be found in these pages, as well as characters of different ethnicities, ages and levels of expertise. For more faboo science books, please refer to my previous annual mini-reviews of the 10 best books about astronomy, physics, chemistry and mathematics in 2016 and 2017. Many thanks to the publishers and their publicity agents who graciously sent review copies of their beautiful books far off the beaten track to snowy Norway.",SCIENCE
" It might have enough energy density to stop its expansion and recollapse, it might have so little energy density that it would never stop expanding, but gravity was certain to slow the expansion as time went on. The universe is full of matter and the attractive force of gravity pulls all matter together. Maybe it was a result of a long-discarded version of Einstein’s theory of gravity, one that contained what was called a “cosmological constant.” Maybe there was some strange kind of energy-fluid that filled space. We know how much dark energy there is because we know how it affects the universe’s expansion. One explanation for dark energy is that it is a property of space. Then one version of Einstein’s gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant, makes a second prediction: “empty space” can possess its own energy. Another explanation for how space acquires energy comes from the quantum theory of matter. Another explanation for dark energy is that it is a new kind of dynamical energy fluid or field, something that fills all of space but something whose effect on the expansion of the universe is the opposite of that of matter and normal energy. That would not only affect the expansion of the universe, but it would also affect the way that normal matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies behaved. This fact would provide a way to decide if the solution to the dark energy problem is a new gravity theory or not: we could observe how galaxies come together in clusters. The thing that is needed to decide between dark energy possibilities — a property of space, a new dynamic fluid, or a new theory of gravity — is more data, better data. By fitting a theoretical model of the composition of the universe to the combined set of cosmological observations, scientists have come up with the composition that we described above, ~68% dark energy, ~27% dark matter, ~5% normal matter. Second, it is not in the form of dark clouds of normal matter, matter made up of particles called baryons. High concentrations of matter bend light passing near them from objects further away, but we do not see enough lensing events to suggest that such objects to make up the required 25% dark matter contribution. Baryonic matter could still make up the dark matter if it were all tied up in brown dwarfs or in small, dense chunks of heavy elements. But the most common view is that dark matter is not baryonic at all, but that it is made up of other, more exotic particles like axions or WIMPS (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). It doesn’t interact with baryonic matter and it’s completely invisible to light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, making dark matter impossible to detect with current instruments. This puzzling result makes sense if one assumes that the boundary stars are feeling the gravitational effects of an unseen mass — dark matter — in a halo around the galaxy. Dark matter could also explain certain optical illusions that astronomers see in the deep universe. For example, pictures of galaxies that include strange rings and arcs of light could be explained if the light from even more distant galaxies is being distorted and magnified by massive, invisible clouds of dark matter in the foreground-a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. One leading hypothesis is that dark matter consists of exotic particles that don’t interact with normal matter or light but that still exert a gravitational pull. Several scientific groups, including one at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, are currently working to generate dark matter particles for study in the lab. Other scientists think the effects of dark matter could be explained by fundamentally modifying our theories of gravity. Scientists now think that the accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by a kind of repulsive force generated by quantum fluctuations in otherwise “empty” space. Unlike for dark matter, scientists have no plausible explanation for dark energy. According to one idea, dark energy is a fifth and previously unknown type of fundamental force called quintessence, which fills the universe like a fluid. Many scientists have also pointed out that the known properties of dark energy are consistent with a cosmological constant, a mathematical Band-Aid that Albert Einstein added to his theory of general relativity to make his equations fit with the notion of a static universe. Einstein later discarded the idea when astronomical observations revealed that the universe was expanding, calling the cosmological constant his “biggest blunder.” Now that we see the expansion of the universe is accelerating, adding in dark energy as a cosmological constant could neatly explain how space-time is being stretched apart.",SCIENCE
"  One of my favorite subjects when I was studying Physics was the concept of entropy, and how it relates to pretty much everything, from ice cubes to the whole Universe. Physically, entropy is a quantity that is proportional to the number of “microscopic configurations” that are consistent with the observed “macroscopic state”. There is a certain number of combinations of the molecules that correspond to the initial system configuration (water plus ice). Consider leaving the glass of water with the ice cube in a room and then checking back on it at a randomly chosen time between now and, say, a year from now. This a a way to think about entropy: The state with water plus ice is the state of lowest entropy because it is such an unlikely configuration in the overall timeline. One of the fundamental insights from Physics is that what happens with the ice cube/water system happens in fact to every physical system - entropy will always increase. Consider two videos, one in which an ice cube slowly melts in a glass of water, and another in which the reverse happens, an ice cube slowly materializing in a glass of water. In such a universe, we could not distinguish between a video of a melting ice cube played forwards and backwards, and there would be no such thing as the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Now here’s the interesting thing: The primordial Universe is the configuration of the Universe with the lowest overall entropy. If you choose a random time to observe the Universe, it is far more likely to find it with some randomly formed clumps, than in a state where everything is distributed homogeneously. On a time scale much longer that the current age of the Universe, all stars will ultimately burn out, all planets will leave their orbits and will be consumed by larger bodies, and galaxies will cease to exists. So next time you are having iced water think about this: the most likely state of Universe, on a time scale of googols of years, is the state of maximum entropy, the heat death. Let me conclude with an analogy between the concept of entropy and life: by default, everything in our lives tends to become a mess, or a state of high entropy, unless we put energy and attention into it. A point could be made that the things that give the most meaning and purpose to life are exactly those things that locally reduce entropy, and therefore go against the natural tendency of the Universe towards disorder.",SCIENCE
"  Part I introduced the construct of emplaced abstraction and situated it within dialogues of science communication work; Part III applies these ideas to three examples of credible and trustworthy science writing; and Part IV concludes with a simple sample assignment and list of primary sources. Science writing involves the process of abstracting at multiple levels, with great concern for word choice that highlights relationships between primary elements and influential forces. In the A Field Guide for Science Writers chapter on writing about nature, McKay Jenkins points out that such writing brings about “the challenge of the poet: With lofty, often abstract imaginative aspirations, he or she must find the most vivid details with which to express them.” Jenkins invokes Aldo Leopold’s description of encountering the fierce green fire fading in the eyes of a wolf he had just shot — a turning point toward Leopold’s thinking more like a mountain and less like a man. DDT is “a subject for environmental reporting,” Jenkins says, whereas “hubris is a subject for nature writing.” The best nature writing, he says, will invigorate the space “between hard science and artistic abstraction.” In the science communicator’s want to explore broad topics, Jenkins addresses the challenge of devising narrative strategies to convey abstract ideas. These narrative strategies are the “teaspoon of sugar to help the medicine go down.” Jenkins uses a simple conceptual model comprised of two circles and an arrow to illustrate connections between particularity — drawn from data such as observation, interviews, and expeditions — and broader philosophical questions related to topics such as species extinction, climate change, the mind of a wolf, or indiscriminate use of chemicals. By identifying potential polarities in a storyline and highlighting relationships between higher order abstractions and context-rich particularity, students can better envision both the forest and the trees, as it were. The concept and image of the abstraction ladder, itself based on work by Alfred Korzybski, has been a useful guide for communication instructors and students wishing to enact critical thinking while developing effective writing practice across the curriculum. Journalist and writing instructor Roy Peter Clark of the Poynter Institute references Hayakawa’s abstraction ladder in a short interjection for the Neiman Foundation collection Telling True Stories: A Nonfiction Writer’s Guide. Identifying and integrating elements from both the top and the bottom of the abstraction ladder helps address a common problem of getting mired in the “muddle of the middle.” “Writing at the top of the ladder is telling,” Clark says, whereas “writing at the bottom of the ladder is showing, presenting detail.” A common mantra in journalism is “show, don’t tell.” For students just learning how to integrate methods of storytelling with evidence-based insights from credible scientific sources, it can be useful to encourage a “show and tell” approach. In level three, abstractions move into noun classes which cluster people, places or events into broader groups with minimal specification. Elaborating on Hayakawa’s “Bessie” example or other specific abstractions, such as Chung has done, may be a useful point-of-entry for student writers to explore the parameters of their topic ideas and the relationships between elements within. While the prior examples were developed from and by writers specifically to help students better define and delineate their topical choices, humanistic geographer Robert Sack developed his relational geographic framework in the 1990s to explore the role of place in creating knowledge. Sack’s model has been interpreted and developed by researchers such as Daniel Williams to explore and extend concepts of place in environmental tourism, place-based conservation, and human dimensions of natural resources management. Sack’s cone of knowledge stretches from the vertex of emplaced ontological forces — materiality (nature), meaning, and social relations — to wider generalizations of ecology, environmental ethics, psychology, economics, and politics. First, such abstraction is “a decontextualizing process that results in a loss or ‘thinning’ of meaning” as evidenced by the general propensity of scientific discourse to overlook influential factors such as everyday experience or meanings of place from a phenomenological perspective. Second, knowledge production at the open end of the cone tends to become highly fragmented by way of discipline-specific methodologies; abstraction in the traditional academic sense has tended to isolate and segment understandings of particular people interacting in particular places within the context of larger social-ecological forces. The critical pluralism Williams has called for (see his 2014 article) helps researchers to not only identify influential factors at the cone’s narrow end and more universal, often discipline-specific, theoretical paradigms at the top; it also identifies mezzo layers of epistemological, axiological, and ontological betweenness informed not only by technoscientific discourse but also humanistic elements of history, culture, and place. These frameworks offer useful guides for developing the parameters and central elements of cohesive narrative nonfiction stories, particularly those dealing with terrestrial or place-based phenomena. While experienced writers likely already have useful systems in place and can draw on the first-hand experience of developing engaging evidence-based narratives, beginning and intermediate writers may find these frameworks more useful as they move from research and reporting to outline, drafting, and revision. Identifying central narrative elements — key people, places, scenes, plot points, and transitions — at the outset of a project is helpful in identifying the parameters of emerging story ideas.",SCIENCE
"  Science and environmental communication often rely on place-based narrative elements to explore relationships between particularity and abstraction. Hayakawa’s abstraction ladder with aspects of R. Sack’s relational geographic framework, a useful tool emerges for identifying narrative dimensions and creating compelling place-based nonfiction. This tool may be particularly useful in science communication teaching and learning at the undergraduate level or early graduate level. Sack’s relational geographic framework explores the role of place in creating knowledge, stretching from a focal point of emplaced ontological forces — materiality, meaning, and social relations — through increasingly abstract knowledge and value dimensions. Part IV: A simple teaching tool useful for distinguishing central narrative elements and relationships in an emerging story. Sack’s cone of knowledge stretches from a foundational vertex of emplaced ontological forces — pinpointing place as the intersection of materiality (nature), meaning, and social relations — to wider generalizations of scientific ecologies, experiential psychologies, and normative/evaluative frameworks at the open end of the cone. Using these models, science writers can identify central elements of their story as well as the relationships between those elements. Doing so can help construct meaning and describe relationships between emplaced particularities and useful universals while avoiding lingering in the often-used but less-than-helpful muddle of the middle. Donal Carbaugh invokes the ladder metaphor in his forward to Environmental Communication: Pedagogy and Practice when connecting links between particles, chemicals, organisms, and bioregions each “as a rung on a ladder.” There is “a ladder of understanding… or similarly a nested conceptualization of matters,” Carbaugh says, that can be used “each time we move up or down the ladder of discourses” to offer new perspectives on familiar relationships. Scaling up and down the ladder of abstraction is also echoed as a micro-to-macro continuum in the 2013 National Academies of Science Science of Science Communication colloquium structure. Topics were arranged from a “micro-to-macro arc, beginning with the analytical research needed to reduce the vast volume of research that scientists could communicate to kernels of information that their audiences most need.” Moving to-and-fro from general contexts to practical kernels of specific insight, science communicators can build trust and credibility by helping audiences navigate the parameters and relational components of their glocal stories. To take “a global issue and make it meaningful at the local or the personal level,” Leshner said, connects ideas across levels of abstraction and is “one of the most important principles of communicating anything effectively.” As part of a 2016 workshop hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, Lee Gutkind and Laura Helmuth had an open discussion about conveying science to popular audiences. Noting the challenge of telling a good story while also conveying factual information Gutkind, author and writing professor at Arizona State University, noted that people often forget details of a fact-filled presentation but that audiences “will never forget the story.” Helmuth, science editor at the Washington Post, added that “the best way to get people to pay attention to what you are doing is to tell stories.” Using the devices of good storytelling — metaphors, imagery, scenes, plot, transitions, etc. — helps to translate and contextualize technical or scientific topics that may be unfamiliar a general audience, which is to say an audience without field-specific knowledge of the science topics at hand. For students just beginning to think of their various technical papers, research essays, experiential reflections, and multimedia projects as stories, structural frameworks can be a useful organizational tool for identifying central narrative elements prior to the in-depth writing and revision process. Courses I teach include Environmental Communication, New Media, Environmental Journalism, and Science Writing for a Lay Audiences. At Unity, where sustainability science buttresses all curriculum, many students are focused on science but do not often get explicit training in science communication via their regular lab-based courses. In my courses, we make the distinction between science communication and scientific communication, the latter tending to be structurally formulaic, rigid in tone, and burdened with passive voice and field-specific jargon. Guided by principles discussed in edited volumes such as The Field Guide for Science Writers, I encourage students to choose topics that address the intersections of social-ecological systems. This series on emplaced abstraction is an effort to identify and elaborate on frameworks that seem useful for helping students think through and construct trustworthy and credible place-based science writing.

" The picture on display changes as well, a few bits at a time. But even the best of screens display horrible visuals when seen through the eyes of a housefly. Screens are designed for humans, who think much slower than flies. You can make out how slow humans are when they try to attack a fly. Their rolled-up newspaper glides slowly towards it, sending out a gust of compressed air before it. It makes use of its eye to watch how the newspaper is approaching. And by the time the newspaper hits, the fly is already far away. But how fast does time seem to go by? And you’ll likely evolve to perceive things faster too. Flies have a higher metabolic rate than humans. They can do everything faster, including calculating where the fly-swatter’s going to land. But if flies are fast, then bacteria are even faster. The Plasmodium flies through the blood and finds itself inside a new reservoir. Rich in food and nutrients, this is the perfect place to start breeding. The blood makes its slow, plodding way up the artery, revealing new forks and veins and pathways on the side. A long time later, this blood, too, will become unliveable. Maybe the whole system will collapse entirely, the blood flow stopping and drying out. Or maybe it’ll keep going right on, but becoming a more and more difficult place to live in. Now, the blood is fresh, and whatever disasters may be waiting to happen, will be sorted out and dealt with by future generations. To a bacterium, humans would seem really very slow. They’d be like trees: look at them, leave them, come back much later, and they might have moved a bit. The speed of bacteria’s lives makes them useful for scientists, who can quickly grow many generations in a lab and see how the evolve. Of course, they do it to larger creatures too, including mice and fruit-flies. They probably see time a bit faster than us, but in the larger scale of things, the difference is tiny. But even a minimally-used drainpipe can seem like a continuous stream when heard through the roots of a guava tree. As it makes its way to the water-source, humans are zipping about with their various activities. They dart in and out of the house multiple times a day, sometimes alighting briefly on a branch for just enough time to pluck off some fruit. It makes its way in through a hairline crack, expanding inside to block the flow, so that it can drink its fill. Two humans tunnel in through the ground, and before the tree knows it, its root is gone, the ground sealed up, and the broken pipe replaced with a new one. Trees are the slowest-living creatures on the planet. Some years ago, scientists were studying a new kind of microbe. It lived deep down, thousands of metres under the ocean floor, where no man had ever looked before and no sunlight had ever reached. Instead of getting energy from plants or sunlight, they used ‘chemosynthesis’ — chemical reactions with sediments and rocks. With such interesting creatures, it’s no surprise that scientists took them up to grow in the lab. Fresh soil gets drawn in by the raging sea, and sinks down over time to the feeding site. The Indian subcontinent breaks away from the Pangean landmass, and the shifting replenishes the food supply. Why do we think in terms of nine-billion cæsium atom vibrations, rather than nine-thousand or nine-quadrillion? All the life that we’re familiar with — which is to say, the ones that live near the surface — come into contact with a periodic clock: the Sun. But those deep subsurface microbes have never seen the Sun. So why stick to a random, entirely arbitrary timescale? Instead, they’ve chosen one that’s more attuned to the long, slow nutrition they get. Taken out by scientists, and fed with all the food they want, perhaps they’ll speed up a little. At Snipette, we encourage questions, comments, corrections and clarifications — even if they are something that can be easily Googled!",SCIENCE
" Figure 2: Cross-Sectional Diagram of the Rotor Blade 8.3. Figure 6: Cross-Sectional Diagram of the Powerloop Showing the Relative Positions of the Stator and Rotor Components 8.7. The rotor is suspended within the stator by means of magnetic levitation. On the inner circular surface of the rotor are semicircular permanent magnets, known as permanent magnet suspension/propulsion pedals, which, in conjunction with the suspension/propulsion ring on the inner circular surface of the stator, acts as the initial suspension and propulsion mechanism (actuator). The suspension/propulsion rings and the suspension/propulsion pedals are placed such that their like poles are facing each other, causing magnetic repulsion(thrust) between the suspension/propulsion ring on the stator and the suspension/propulsion pedals on the rotor. The curved edges of the suspension/propulsion pedals is approximately 50% longer than their linear counterparts. Likewise, the amount of thrust acting along the curved edges of the pedals is equally greater than the amount of thrust acting along the linear edges of the pedals. The differences in the amount of thrust along the curved and linear edges of the suspension/propulsion pedals causes the rotor to spin. As the rotor begins to spin, the magnetic field lines of permanent magnet array interacts with the stator windings to produce a flow of current along the stator windings. The generated electric current is then channeled through the wire conductor to the control unit, which the uses part of the received currency to magnetize the electromagnetic suspension ring and the rest is transmitted to the liquid connector. The liquid connector connects the spinning conducting rod on the rotor and the conducting wire in such a way as to minimize friction. The current is then transmitted from the liquid connector through the conducting rod to the control unit on the rotor. The control unit uses the received current to magnetize the electromagnet suspension and propulsion pedals and the electromagnet array. The electromagnetic suspension and propulsion pedals and the electromagnetic suspension and propulsion ring being of opposite polarity produces additional suspension and propulsion effect thereby increasing the rotational momentum of the stator. The upper surface of the rotor blade is shorter than its lower surface and is trailing edge is curved upward to deflect the air passing over the trailing edge of the rotor blade in an upward trajectory. While the rotor blades are spinning, air on the upper surface has a shorter distance to travel compared to air on the lower surface of the rotor blades. According to Bernoulli’s principle, their is a correspondingly greater air pressure acting on the upper surface of the rotor blades compared to the lower surface of the rotor blades thereby producing a downward aerodynamic force. Also, due to the curvature of of the rotor blade, air passing over the trailing edge of the rotor blade is deflected in an upward direction. According to Newton’s Third law of motion, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.Since the air is being deflected upward, an equal and opposite force must be acting downward on the rotor blade and the rotor itself. As the stator is lowered toward the floor (inner circular surface) of stator by the two aerodynamic forces outlined above, the magnetic fields between the suspension and propulsion pedals and the suspension and propulsion rings are squeezed into a very thin film of high pressure zone. As the magnetic fields between the pedals and the rings gets thinner, the amount of thrust generated but their repulsive effect equally gets stronger, consequently producing a greater rotational momentum on the rotor. The greater the rotational momentum of the rotor, the greater the the amount of current generated through the stator windings. More current produced by the stator winding means more current is fed back into the electricity generation system and the process repeats itself recursively in one endless loop. Its main components include: a) Permanent Magnet Suspension/Propulsion Ring — Acts as axial(thrust) magnetic bearing by levitating the rotor within the stator. It also contributes the initial magnetic thrust(repulsive force) necessary to induce the rotor into a rotational momentum. b) Electromagnet Suspension/Propulsion Ring — Are magnetised after the rotor has begun spinning, by the current produced by the permanent magnets. Acts as axial(thrust) magnetic bearing by levitating the rotor within the stator. It also contributes additional magnetic thrust(repulsive force) that steps up the rotational momentum of the rotor. c) Permanent Magnet Suspension/Propulsion Pedals — Acts as axial magnetic bearings by levitating the rotor within the inner circular surfaces of the stator. It also contributes the initial magnetic thrust(repulsive force) necessary to induce the rotor into a rotational momentum. d) Electromagnet Suspension/Propulsion Pedals — Are magnetised after the rotor has begun pinning, by the current produced by the permanent magnets. Acts as axial(thrust) magnetic bearing by levitating the rotor within the stator. It also contributes additional magnetic thrust(repulsive force) that steps up the rotational momentum of the rotor. When the rotor is spinning, magnetic flux from the permanent magnet array interacts with the stator windings to produce initial current needed to power the electromagnetic components of the powerloop. i) Control Unit — Regulates the amount of current being transmitted to each of the electromagnet suspension and propulsion pedals (i.e the strength of the electromagnets) and consequently the rotational momentum of the rotor. The rotor is suspended within the stator by means of magnetic levitation. On the inner circular surface of the rotor are semicircular permanent magnets, known as permanent magnet suspension/propulsion pedals, which, in conjunction with the suspension/propulsion ring on the inner circular surface of the stator, acts as the initial suspension and propulsion mechanism (actuator).

The initial current produced by the permanent magnets is used to power the electromagnetic suspension and propulsion ring and the electromagnetic suspension and propulsion pedals together with the electromagnet array. Thrust differences between the curved edges and the linear edges of the suspension/propulsion pedals produce a resultant rotational momentum on the rotor hence flow of current in the stator windings. As the rotor spins, the aerodynamic forces acting on the rotor blades pushes the rotor downward, bringing the like poles of the suspension and propulsion rings and the suspension and propulsion pedals closer together.

" Whether or not a planetesimal had seen major magmatism may completely change its nature, so that we now distinguish between so-called ‘chondritic’ and ‘achondritic’ asteroids to distinguish the non-magmatic and magmatically altered planetesimal materials: chondritic meteorites are thought to represent planetesimals that formed late enough to escape the most intense radiogenic heating. In principle there are two main end-member scenarios for what may happen to an internally heated planetesimal: (i) the solid rock starts melting, but the outer layers remain cool and solid due to effective heat loss to space, such that the melt piles up in the interior. (ii) As the rock melts, the magma, which is usually less dense than rock, is transported to the planetesimal surface, where it erupts in possibly extensive surface volcanism. 2 Myr after the formation of the solar system, typically partitions into the melt phase of a melt–solid aggregate and may thus be removed to the surface by volcanism. These two end-member types produce very different predictions for how evolved bodies should look like at present day: scenario (i) says an evolved body from the first planetesimal generation would have a primitive surface, but a chemically differentiated internal structure due to phase separations such as exsolution and demixing of various silicate phases, or core formation during the vigorous interior magma ocean stages, which I have covered in an earlier blog post. It is our goal in this study to map these two scenarios: what kind of physical and chemical parameters would lead to a rocky planetesimal to either fall into category (i) or (ii), and under what conditions would one of them dominate? The most important parameters that define the melt segregation number are hidden in the time scales for heating and melting (please check the paper for full details): the melt–rock density contrast, which is a function of the initial oxidation state of the host rock (and likely connected to the initial water content of the planetesimal upon gravitational collapse from the protoplanetary disk material), and most importantly, the so-called grain size, the mean size of the smallest units of the rock matrix within the planetesimal, which controls the efficiency of both melt percolation and rock deformation (see here for an introduction on grain size in geodynamic modeling). These represent planetesimals that are formed in the first ≈ 2 million years after the formation of the solar system, and therefore most likely represent the primary building blocks and seeds of the terrestrial planets. For such bodies, a high segregation number represents a high propensity of melt segregation (which leads to magma sills), whereas bodies with a low segregation number will keep their melt confined (internal magmatism, think 21 Lutetia). In the context from the two scenarios from above (interior magmatism versus surface volcanism), our model results give clarification that reality isn’t binary (either scenario is ‘true’ and the other ‘false’), but that we now understand better what conditions of planetesimal formation may lead to what outcome of early evolution. There is a clear trend with formation time: during the first million years after solar system formation, the heating inside of planetesimals was so intense that magma accumulated in the interior no matter what–these bodies were hot pots of molten rock. At the transition formation time of ≈ 1 million years though, the temperatures were still high enough to melt a substantial fraction of the rock, but the magma could escape quickly towards shallower regions of the planetesimal mantle, taking parts of the Al-26 with it. This may lead to magma transport towards the surface, and thus eventually to active volcanism on the earliest rocky bodies of the solar system! The consequences of these regimes highlight some remaining issues, which will lead to further debate and may open the path for a better understanding of rocky planet formation in the early solar system: Finally, in the continued quest to unravel the early history and accretion of our solar system planets, future spacecraft missions will tremendously help in delivering crucial insights into the structure of current-day rocky bodies.",SCIENCE
"  In the field of quantum computers, many university research groups bet on trapped ions. Many universities have strong expertise in Atomic Physics and have the know-how on manipulate quantum information in the atomic level. Instead of using atoms to store quantum information, engineers print artificial “quantum system” in a circuit for the qubits (where quantum computers store information). In this article, we will focus on the superconducting circuit and reserve another article for the trapped ion quantum computer. But we will have a high-level overview for some of the most promising quantum computer technologies at the end of the article. We can explore the quantum property of atoms, or we can build an artificial system that mimics the quantum states. A trapped ions quantum computer uses lasers to change the energy level of laser-cooled ions trapped in an electric field. On the other hand, the processor inside the IBM Q quantum computer holds superconducting circuits to create an artificial quantum system. The IBM Q contains cables to send microwave pulses at different frequencies and durations to control and to measure the qubits. To isolate the qubits, the computer contains a dilution refrigerator to cool down the quantum processor to 15 miliKelvin. We don’t want our circuitry implementing the artificial quantum system to have resistance. Otherwise, it will dissipate energy and destroy the quantum information. This gap leads to superconductivity since small excitations such as scattering of electrons (resistance) are not allowed (yet another non-intuitive behavior from quantum mechanics). As recalled in trapped ions computer, its energy level are uneven. The control signal that promoting quantum state |0⟩ to |1⟩ will not accidentally promote the quantum state to a higher level, the superposition will confine between |0⟩ and |1⟩. It is non-linear such that the energy level is unevenly separated so we can use two lower states as the bases for our superpositions. With correct tuning, the circuit behaves like an atom with two quantum energy level, i.e. Quantum gates (operations) are performed by sending electromagnetic impulses at microwave frequencies (around 4–6 KHz) to the resonator coupled to the qubit. In Trapped ions computer, we use laser beams to control ions. This method can entangle two arbitrary qubits on the string of ions. In superconducting qubits, the coupling of two qubits is done by coupling them to a quantum bus. For example, for the 5 qubits IBM Q, there are 20 possible combinations in pairing qubits, but only 6 of them are implemented. There are three major ways to do it in a superconducting quantum computer: Charge Qubit, Flux Qubit & Phase Qubit. In the charge qubit, different energy levels correspond to an integer number of Cooper pairs on a superconducting island. Maintain an extremely low temperature is important in a superconducting quantum computer. The quantum processor sits inside the Cryoperm shield, a light-tight and a magnetic-field shield, used to isolate the qubits from environmental disturbances. The quality of a quantum computer is often measured by its decoherence. T1 and T2 measures how fast the quantum information stored in the qubit may lose. As shown below, we make very good progress in the superconducting quantum computers over the years. Trapped ions quantum computer is another popular realization of quantum computers. i.e., we know how to use these ions to create qubits. The following is a recap on the superconducting and trapped ions quantum computer: Trapped ions have longer coherence time compared to a superconducting circuit but the gate operation time is faster in the superconducting circuit. Google has built a 72-qubit superconducting quantum computer in 2018 while the number of qubits for the trapped ions is much lower. Trapped ions need a vacuum chamber while the superconducting needs a diluted refrigerator. Trapped ions are all “natural” and identical while the gate performance for each qubit in the superconducting computer is slightly different. Not all qubits in a superconducting computer are connected to form 2-qubit operations. Superconducting circuits work with microwaves while trapped ions system often involves lasers which are harder to integrate into the system. Neutral Atoms Neutral atoms quantum computers use neutral atom instead of charged ions in the trapped ions computer. It inflates the atom to billion times and reaches the Rydberg state — which the electrons are excited to a high principal quantum number close to 100 and become sensitive to external influences including microwave radiation. Quantum dots quantum computer A single electron trapped in a semiconductor structure can form the basic building block for a qubit. We use the microwave to control the spin of the elections to construct the silicon quantum dots. Here is another view of the quantum dots: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond Diamond is made up of carbon atoms. In quantum computing, we often look for energy states that have long coherence time with easy ways to initialize them and manipulate them. So just similar to the trapped ion, once these transition rules are known and quantify, we can design a quantum computer from them. However, how to create entanglement (2-qubit operator) can be tricky for NV center quantum computers. So stay tuned for trapped ion quantum computer next.",SCIENCE
" I know I did; I immediately thought “siblings, right?” Long story short, yes, you can be genetically closer to your siblings than your parents, but you’re considered to be about equally related to both your parents and siblings. Doing the math At first thought, the math may seem easy: you and your siblings have the same 50/50 chance of inheriting one allele or the other from each parent. Therefore, wouldn’t you be equally half-related to each one of your parents and siblings? However, there is one more component to consider: you are almost exactly half-related to each parent because half of your DNA comes from each of them. On the other hand, you are only half-related to your siblings on average, meaning you could share more or less DNA with your siblings. Statistically, siblings could theoretically be anywhere from 0 to 100% related if they got none or all of the same alleles. Consider the following possible heredity situations, which look at 2 pairs of chromosomes, for simplicity: Each sibling has 50% of the same genes as each parent, but the variety of possible allele combinations gives a range of reliability between siblings. The odds of siblings being “0%” related is extremely slim, estimated to be about one in ten million if you just consider the 23 chromosomes as is! However, considering other genetic factors, like mitochondrial DNA, the Y chromosome, and genetic recombination, siblings actually cannot be “0%” related. Looking deeper The simple examples so far have excluded more complex genetic factors, such as the sex chromosomes, mitochondrial DNA, genetic recombination, and new mutations. Similarly, siblings share their mitochondrial DNA with each other and their mother because their mitochondria only come from the mother’s egg. Genetic recombination shuffles alleles between chromosome pairs in a parent’s cells as the pairs get split up into sex cells through a process called meiosis. This creates sex cells with different combinations of alleles in each parent, which can be uniquely combined to create each child. Despite being a unique combination of your parent’s genes and new mutations, you are, on average, equally genetically close to both your parents and siblings.",SCIENCE
" Literally meaning “above the genes”, epigenetic changes are chemical modifications to your DNA that act as “on/off” switches for genes, changing gene expression without altering the gene’s code directly. Importantly, the epigenome can be passed down throughout generations, affecting children’s traits by altering gene expression without changing the DNA code. Epigenetics and its relation to health Everything you do affects your epigenome, from your environment and sleeping habits to diet and exercise. Epigenetics also plays an important role in disease, especially cancers, so understanding how to alter the epigenome is important. Increased methylation of certain DNA regions, called gene promoters, turns genes “off”. Polyphenols (found in green tea, coffee, red wine, fruits, and vegetables) are known to turn “on” certain genes by direct demethylation or inhibition of methylation enzymes. Folate intake is linked to higher methylation of a specific growth factor gene (IGF2), which turns “off” the growth factor and can help prevent cancer, such as colorectal cancer. Various genes were turned “off” via increased promoter methylation in colorectal cancer patients who drank heavily versus those who drank little to no alcohol. Genes involved in two regulatory pathways (MGMT and WNT) were turned “off” via increased promoter methylation in head and neck cancer patients who drank versus nondrinkers. While exercise is known for its multitude of beneficial health effects, it has also been linked to altering DNA methylation. Six months of aerobic exercise caused DNA methylation changes in muscle and fat tissues, which directly affected fat creation and storage. Exercise in sedentary young people showed reduced methylation in a leg muscle (vastus lateralis) at certain promoters of genes involved in metabolism (PGC-1α, PDK4, and PPAR-δ), which beneficially increased metabolism. Most of the affected genes were involved in inflammation, energy metabolism, and insulin response with the epigenetic changes resulting in healthier muscles. Exercise was suggested to provide protective anti-cancer effects by turning “on” tumor suppressor genes through decreasing methylation. Epigenetics is particularly important during two key periods: “critical windows” in early development, and “dietary transitions” in adults, such as chronic overeating, a high-fat diet, or chronic caloric restriction. Although the harmful agouti gene was passed down from mother to baby, increased methylation of the gene from the methyl-rich diet turned “off” the gene, producing babies that were brown, slender, lived longer, and were less susceptible to cancer and diabetes. Supplementing maternal nutrition with methyl donors such as folate, originally intended to prevent brain and spine defects, may also alter epigenetic gene regulation during embryo development. Although regular moderate exercise during pregnancy is believed to be beneficial to both the mother and child, there is little research on the epigenetic changes induced by maternal exercise.",SCIENCE
"  For families with children affected by incurable rare diseases — like Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects girls — finding a cure is crucial. “Rett syndrome is a severe disorder that has been described as a combination of autism, cerebral palsy, Parkinson’s, epilepsy, and anxiety disorder all in one little girl. It is the second most common cause of severe intellectual disability in girls after Down syndrome,” Jeannie Lee, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and lead researcher on a paper published in PNAS earlier this year, wrote over email. Girls with Rett syndrome, caused by a mutated gene on the X chromosome, appear normal when they’re born. Males affected by Rett syndrome usually die shortly after birth because the mutation is so severe, and they only have one X chromosome — the mutated one. In a girl with one normal and one mutated gene, this X-inactivation (called “Xi”) causes about half of her cells to be ‘mutated’ and the other half to be ‘normal.’ Rett syndrome’s severity varies based on differences in the mutation and amount of “normal” cells. This combination directly addresses the cause of the disease by reversing X-inactivation to turn on the normal gene through a process called Xi reactivation, rather than just treating the symptoms. The protein missing in Rett syndrome (methyl-CpG binding protein 2, or MECP2) was restored in mouse cells using a combination of two drugs. One drug prevented X-inactivation, turning the normal gene on to make more MECP2 protein. Interestingly, only the combination of drugs worked — each drug alone didn’t have a large effect on Xi reactivation. A previous study also showed that increasing MECP2 levels, in a different Rett syndrome mouse model, restored cognitive function and survival to normal values. “Boosting MECP2 levels to a degree that can alleviate seizures and breathing abnormalities would be a major benefit.” Carrette added that it’s “important to establish whether these small levels of reactivation have a therapeutic effect in other mouse models and to translate these findings from mice to humans.” Ensuring these drugs work in mice with Rett syndrome paves the way for their potential use in Rett syndrome patients. Ultimately, this drug combination seems promising in the quest to find a “key” to unlock the cure to severe rare diseases, like Rett syndrome, from within patients’ own cells.",SCIENCE
" It seems strange to believe that we’ll find a way to live forever — a trait we see as divine and super-powerful — before we create the technology to visit our nearest star systems. Of the many technologies tested and considered for long distance travel — from Alcubierre warp drives to Bussard ramjets — few remain as controversial and yet persistent as the EmDrive. Having to carry fuel and propellant limits current chemical rockets because of the added weight and because that fuel must be used not only to blast off from Earth’s surface but also to slow down once arriving at their destination. Yet without the need for these two components, space travel could be significantly faster, more efficient, and come at a much cheaper price. To understand how the drive (which can be categorized as a microwave resonant cavity thruster) works, imagine a copper cylinder bigger at one end than at the other. Thus the internal radiation field could provide a different pressure and acceleration on one end of the cone because of its shape, giving you thrust with no propellant required. Because it simply requires initial power which can then be converted into thrust, the EmDrive has been likened to a perpetual motion machine where the machine can continue to function without an ongoing source of power. And so NASA’s Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory, also known as Eagleworks Laboratories, decided to build one of their own with seemingly promising results. Their test results, published in a 2016 paper, showed their EmDrive generating positive thrust at different power levels (40, 60, and 80 Watts) and in both hard vacuums and normal air at atmospheric pressure. The problem with tests at atmospheric pressure is that thermal convection in the air can skew test results and produce thrust that isn’t really there. If Newton’s Third Law of Motion says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, there is no action of the EmDrive that should create an acceleration because it is a closed system and momentum within the cone will simply get redistributed. If a photon were to escape the copper enclosure, then it becomes a photon thruster and no longer an EmDrive. In fact, the drive also violates special relativity, general relativity, and Noether’s therom, meaning that if it were to work — and scientists aren’t even sure how a positive thrust could really be produced— it would uproot our understanding of modern physics. After similar tests were run by a group of German scientists, they concluded that the positive thrust detailed in NASA’s paper was due to interaction between the power cables of the drive and the Earth’s magnetic field. The scientists used a special shield made of mu metal to block out most of the magnetic field but even then, interaction was still observed. During the tests, the German team also reduced the amount of power going to the drive, preventing microwaves from bouncing around inside the cone. Along with this interference from Earth’s magnetic field, any number of causes could also generate thrust. If we do manage to extend our lifespans — or even live forever — perhaps there will come a day when we’re able to create a running EmDrive that works with, instead of violating, our laws of the world.",SCIENCE
" Ciro Vila tweeted a link to Alien imposters: Planets with oxygen don’t necessarily have life, which led me to the paper, “Gas Phase Chemistry of Cool Exoplanet Atmospheres: Insight from Laboratory Simulations” by Chao He, Sarah M. Hörst, Nikole K. Lewis, Julianne I. Moses, Eliza M.-R. Kempton, Mark S. Marley, Caroline V. Morley, Jeff A. Valenti, and Véronique Vuitton. I also found the article Don’t Let Oxygen Fool You: As a sign of life on other planets, oxygen may not be the smoking gun some of us thought it was by Dirk Schulze-Makuch, which is an exposition of the Narita, et al. As we can see from the case of oxygen, it can be produced by biotic or abiotic processes, so while the finding of oxygen in an exoplanet atmosphere would be exciting, and would probably be hyped by the popular press, scientists would already be well aware that this is not a smoking gun for life. When biology and the life sciences eventually become sufficiently advanced that we can routinely manufacture artificial life in the laboratory (even if we choose not to do so for moral or social reasons), this capacity would make it possible to run an elaborate scientific research program modeling potential forms of life on other worlds. By this I mean that if we take Earth’s self-replicating macro-molecule DNA and try every substitution that we can for the four chemical bases of DNA — adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine — and determine which of these are viable (i.e., those which are also self-replicating macro-molecules), then we would get variations on the theme of DNA, and possibly alternative forms of life, still easily recognizable as life for us. Additionally, we would want to “back breed” Earth life to resemble the earliest life on Earth that we can recognize as life (hopefully by this time we will also have made progress in origins of life research and can be a bit more definite about the immediate precursors to life as we know it), and use the viable variations on the theme of early life to create a large (yet finite) number of models for early biota on a habitable planet (i.e., a habitable planet like Earth, a peer world). This would be like running a scaled up version of the Miller-Urey experiment — again, several different variations on the basic theme — with each experiment populated with one of the variants of artificial “early” life that we have created (either by manufacturing them as artificial life or by back breeding contemporary life to approximate them). Certainly, if we were to conduct scaled up versions of the Miller-Urey experiment and we could bring the development of these experiments all the way to the point of abiotically generating life, then we would simply want to continue this experiment. If a scientific research program of this kind were to be carried out on a grand scale , and over an extended period of time, we would have a pretty good empirical basis for determining the kind of life that can be revealed by exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy.",SCIENCE
"  The context of the CRISPR Cas 9 legal battle had all the elements of a good soap opera: powerhouse scientists with ambitions to literally rewrite human DNA, potentially billions of dollars for the taking, a race to make history, and a surprise twist involving an unknown group of Lithuanian researchers. It’s rare for patent cases to receive so much attention. And considering that scientists found a multitude of other ways to use CRISPR while the case was being argued — suggesting the technique in question may be only one of many — it’s easy to wonder why the case (recently tried in a Federal Appeals Court) ignited such an intense argument between scientists, research institutions, and legal theorists. Six years ago, two genetic researchers, Jennifer Doudna of UC Berkeley and Emmanuelle Charpentier at University of Vienna, published a paper that sent shockwaves through nearly every sphere of the scientific community. Charpentier and Doudna isolated this genetic editing tool and used it to cut and paste genes in a test tube. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats — thankfully called CRISPR for short — sped up experiments that used to take years and completed them in weeks and days. A UK-based lab used CRISPR to wipe out an entire species of mosquitoes, removing their gene that produces female offspring. There are hopes that CRISPR Cas9 can “re-program” the genes that cause diseases like Alzheimer’s, autism, and cancer, while some fear the tool will bring designer babies and biogenetic terrorism in the near-future. Scientists still don’t know how every gene controls and relates to other genes — but CRISPR also provides a much more efficient way to study those relationships.) But then the United States Patent and Trademark Office awarded the patented application of CRISPR Cas9 in eukaryotic cells to Feng Zhang at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The legal patent for applying CRISPR to many of the cells governing human health was not going to UC Berkeley or University of Vienna. Forbes magazine estimates the value of the patent as somewhere in the realm of 265 million dollars, but experts suggest that if CRISPR lives up to the hype, its actual value could be in the billions. Beyond granting its holder the right to use the technique and sell use rights to corporations, the patent also legally establishes the original inventor. Researchers were calling CRISPR Cas9, “the biological discovery of the century.” Holding that kind of patent could define a life, an institution. UC Berkeley and the University of Vienna had filed their patent application in May 2012. He has followed the case closely since its beginning and is able to explain convoluted patent terminology with all the excitement and style of Q showing James Bond the pros and cons of spy accessories. Essentially, Zhang was limited to 20 claims with his patent, while Doudna and Charpentier filed 155 claims. “Usually when you prosecute patent applications, you get to say things like ‘Alright, dear examiner, you don’t like claim one? When UC Berkeley protested the decision, Broad needed to prove that their application of CRISPR Cas9 was their invention — or in lawyer terms: that their invention did not “interfere” with Doudna and Charpentier’s invention. This made the case an interference procedure, which, while rare in patent law, happens with groundbreaking technology. Right in the midst of what otherwise might have been a montage of lawyers preparing for a trial — a la Tom Cruise in A Few Good Men — a group of Lithuanian researchers, led by Virginijus Šikšnys, were suddenly awarded the CRISPR Cas9 patent for prokaryotic cells — the other major cell type, the kind without nucleuses that make up bacteria, among other things. “You’re only seeing the light that was emanating 18 months ago.” Since the Lithuanians did not publish a paper prior to filing a patent application, none of the attorneys, institutions, researchers had any idea that Šikšnys actually filed his application two months before Berkeley. Their finding was that Doudna and Charpentier invented the technique of applying CRISPR Cas9 to cells in a test tube, while Zhang invented the technique of applying it to human DNA. But knowledge of CRISPR was expanding quickly beyond the Cas9 protein, and new techniques have the potential to be just as effective. The slices of CRISPR patent pie might be getting smaller. Since CRISPR use increased so dramatically within such a short time, the discoveries weren’t tested and confirmed in the same way new scientific findings are typically evaluated. Citing family obligations, Doudna left the Massachusetts-based corporation to start a company in her home state of California soon after Broad won the patent. The argument at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in April reveals the tension at the heart of the case. Yet in the case of CRISPR Cas9, the definitions of invention and discovery — nouns that often serve as the bedrock of science and law — could be contested, and were seemingly on trial themselves. Berkeley hired a new, big-name attorney for the appeal — Donald Virilli, the former Solicitor General of the United States who successfully argued President Obama’s Affordable Care Act before the Supreme Court — and when he took the floor, the courtroom was packed once again. When Judge Kimberly Moore goes into a coughing fit, her casual request that Virilli continue argument since speakers were broadcasting the hearing to the back room is met with an unexpected roar of laughter, not unlike a sitcom’s laugh track. He insisted the patent should hinge on the discovery of CRISPR being a tool, that Doudna and Charpentier’s ability to demonstrate its application in a test tube — solving the “problem” — put Broad just a step away from applying CRISPR to human cells. She outlines how Zhang used traditional experimentation and failure to refine and refine until successfully using CRISPR in human cells. The same way Doudna and Charpentier took the discovery of CRISPR’s existence and refined it into a tool. Having lost significant patents to both Broad and Šikšnys, UC Berkeley and University of Vienna are now left picking up the crumbs. In the legal world, Doudna and Charpentier are not likely to be big names, despite being the first ones to demonstrate CRISPR’s use. We should work together to ensure wide, open access to this transformative technology.” Unsurprisingly, UC Berkeley suggested they would continue to look into their legal options, but chances of moving forward in the courts are slim to none. In her book on CRISPR, Doudna mentions the patents only briefly when describing the “heady time” that all of them experienced in the lab during 2012. “Only later would the contents and publication dates of these papers be dissected to support arguments in a dispute over CRISPR patent rights, a disheartening twist to what had begun as collegial interactions and genuine shared excitement about the implications of the research.” In all interviews following the case, the three always shift the topic when patent rights come up. They don’t want to talk about their feelings — “disheartening” is the most open Doudna has ever been on the subject-they want to talk about CRISPR. All research institutions involved are under agreement to share CRISPR Cas9 editing rights freely for education and non-profit purposes. And while Charpentier, Doudna, and Zhang certainly must have felt something when the patent decisions were delivered, their only observable reaction was to stay at work — they never attended a single hearing. In the landmark 2012 paper that started it all, Doudna and Charpentier wrote that CRISPR Cas9, “highlights the potential to exploit the system”, the “system” being the genome of living things.",SCIENCE
"  (Revised draft: 1) I initially wrote that IQ predicts between 10 and 50% at best, turns out it beats random selection in the best of applications by less than 17%, 2) Showed noise IQ/Weath, 3) Added information showing the story behind the effectiveness of Average National IQ is, statistically, a fraud. The psychologists who engaged me on this piece — with verbose writeups —made the mistake of showing me the best they got: papers with the strongest pro-IQ arguments. Background : “IQ” is a stale test meant to measure mental capacity but in fact mostly measures extreme unintelligence (learning difficulties), as well as, to a lesser extent, a form of intelligence, stripped of 2nd order effects. Designed for learning disabilities, and given that it is not too needed there (see argument further down), it ends up selecting for exam-takers, paper shufflers, obedient IYIs (intellectuals yet idiots), ill adapted for “real life”. The concept is poorly thought out mathematically (a severe flaw in correlation under fat tails, fails to properly deal with dimensionality, treats the mind as an instrument not a complex system), and seemed to be promoted by Some argue that IQ measures intellectual capacity — real world results come from, in addition, “wisdom” or patience, or “conscientiousness”, or decision-making or something of the sort. If you want to detect how someone fares at a task, say loan sharking, tennis playing, or random matrix theory, make him/her do that task; we don’t need theoretical exams for a real world function by probability-challenged psychologists. Fat Tails If IQ is Gaussian by construction and if real world performance were, net, fat tailed (it is), then either the covariance between IQ and performance doesn’t exist or it is uninformational. But the “intelligence” in IQ is determined by academic psychologists like the “paper trading” we mentioned above, via statistical constructs s.a. correlation that I show here (see Fig. It does correlate to negative performance (as it was initially designed to detect learning special needs) but then any measure would work there. A measure that works in left tail not right tail (IQ decorrelates as it goes higher) is problematic. To get the point, consider that if someone has mental needs, there will be 100% correlation between performance and IQ tests. (The statistical spin, as a marketing argument, is that a person with an IQ of 70 cannot prove theorems, which is obvious for a measure of unintelligence — but they fail to reveal how many IQs of 150 are doing menial jobs). However, if you take a Popperian-Hayekian view on intelligence, you would realize that to measure it you would need to know the mental skills needed in a future ecology, which requires predictability of said future ecology. 1) When someone asks you a question in the real world, you focus first on “why is he/she asking me that?”, which shifts you to the environment (see Fat Tony vs Dr John in The Black Swan) and detracts you from the problem at hand. 2) Real life never never offers crisp questions with crisp answers (most questions don’t have answers; perhaps the worst problem with IQ is that it seem to selects for people who don’t like to say “there is no answer, don’t waste time, find something else”.) Some people can only focus on problems that are real, not fictional textbook ones (see the note below where I explain that I can only concentrate with real not fictional problems). 4) IQ doesn’t detect convexity (by an argument similar to bias-variance you need to make a lot of small inconsequential mistake in order to avoid a large consequential one. Functionary Quotient: If you renamed IQ , from “Intelligent Quotient” to FQ “Functionary Quotient” or SQ “Salaryperson Quotient”, then some of the stuff will be true.",SCIENCE
" This is probably one of the most famous experiments in 20th century science, and it marks the beginnings of origins of life research as a scientific discipline. ), such that the expansion of the universe will leave galaxies isolated and observers unable to determine the expanding nature of the universe — this would certainly be a blow to large-scale spacefaring civilizations (under these conditions there could be no intergalactic civilizations) and thus to my wishes for a large-scale human future in the universe. Since the time of Miller and Urey’s experiment an enormous amount of work has been done in origins of life research, both from a bottom-up perspective, involving numerous experiments that demonstrate the synthesis of organic molecules from inorganic precursors, as well as a top-down perspective, most notably the molecular phylogeny of Carl Woese, which points to what the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of all life of Earth may have been like (short answer: probably an extremophile). If origins of life research could get the funding for very large scale projects (like, e.g., the ISS, ITER, NIF, and the LHC) — that is to say, if origins of life research were to become big science — it would be possible to undertake a long-term, large-scale origins of life research project that could imitate the conditions of the early Earth on a much larger scale, not not merely the atmospheric conditions, as were simulated in the Miller-Urey experiment, but a range of different conditions present on the early Earth at different times as it passed through its dramatic earliest formation. In addition to particular environments, there would also need to be some kind of simulation of the large scale processes of Earth, since planetary and climatological changes have played a major role in the evolution of life on Earth. If it were possible to build an enormous environment simulating the early Earth across a range of climates, and to run this experiment for years or, better, decades, I suspect that we would learn some interesting things that origins of life research to date has not yet discovered. Just as physicists often observe that new advances in physics come from larger machines that can reach higher energy levels, so too the historical sciences (which include geology, climatology, biology, paleontology, inter alia) will probably benefit from much larger machines and experiments that can can be allowed to run for extended periods of time. With the historical sciences, it is more time that is needed, rather than more energy (although an experiment such as I described would require an enormous amount of energy, it is will well within the limits of contemporary technology). Such an undertaking would not only shed light on origins of life research, but also on our current geophysical and ecological questions that stand at the center of the contemporary debate about the direction of industrial-technological civilization. In my post Earth Science, Planetary Science, Space Science I cited the Wikipedia article on “Space Science” (which no longer includes the tripartite division below) as identifying three meanings of the term: From an astrobiological perspective here is no question that origins of life research is a space science in the sense of the study of space exploration or as the study of everything in outer space. While we can begin the process of astrobiological research on Earth, eventually we will want to study specimens of life elsewhere in the universe, and such specimens must be included in the study of everything in outer space. There is also a sense in which origins of life research might be understood as space science as science that is performed in outer space, i.e., space research — one might even suggest that large-scale origins of life research could only be performed in space, and that this is therefore a science that must await its full development and maturity until spacefaring civilization develops to the point that an extraterrestrial infrastructure is available to the space sciences as “big science.” (In an article jointly written with Jacob Shively, Adventure Science Enters the Space Age, I suggested that “adventure science” will precede “big science” as spacefaring civilization develops, and I continue to believe this, so that the development of space science as “big science” is some way off yet for terrestrial civilization.) The large-scale origins of life project formulated above could be gone one better by origins of life research being conducted as space science on a grand scale. The conditions available on an artificial structure in extraterrestrial space would provide plenty of energy to fuel experiments (sunshine 24 hours per day) as well as the ability to construct a habitat that ranged over conditions from very hot to freezing cold, maintaining these environments for long periods of time, and allowing these environments to communicate with each other while retaining their distinctive climatological conditions. A large and wealthy spacefaring civilization — such as might result from human beings more fully exploiting the resources of our own solar system — might be able to afford such origins of life “big science” without difficulty. It will be a time of great scientific excitement when we are able to explore Mars and the moons and Jupiter and Saturn for signs of life, but beyond looking for life already extant in our solar system, the kind of scientific origins of life research facility I am suggesting would allow for additional perspectives on astrobiology. We might eventually construct custom habitats for specially formulated artificial life, to see how these play out on a large scale without subjecting the biosphere of Earth to possible contamination. And if we secure our longevity as a civilization and eventually become a million-year-old or billion-year-old supercivilization, we would be able to carry out these experiments over evolutionary time scales.",SCIENCE
"  2018 was the year of the ‘Biohacker’, the year when rogue tech hacking approaches and drop-out founder archetypes collided with the normally cautious, PhD-laden biomedical research community. Shift from Small Molecule Blockbusters to Targeted Therapies It is bold to predict the upheaval of business as usual for a multi-billion in annual revenue, decades-old industry, but the days of the of blockbuster small molecule are waning. Competing therapeutic technologies are coming into their own, shifting the focus towards cell-based therapeutics, hardware interventions, or repurposing of known compounds. Furthermore, the next generation of therapeutics entering drug pipelines will contain targets selected by AI screening, likely improving the 96% clinical trial failure rates for small molecules. Improved disease mapping, continued growth in personalized medicine, a motivated patient population, and cost to market reduction for targeted therapeutics will leave the large blockbuster molecule taking a backseat to targeted therapeutics over the next decade. Cells as Therapeutics: Beyond the CAR-T By co-opting the T cell’s natural search and response programing, CAR-T cell therapies have become the first living programed ‘smart’ therapeutic. Future therapeutics and vaccines may consist of a single injection of living cells that serves as a long-lived universal influenza vaccine or suppression of autoimmune disease The next decade will see continued development of human cells as therapeutics that yield long-lasting permanent to semi-permanent results. Imagine being a physician and coalescing all research studies (> 2M scientific articles are published each year), all available secondary information, and then selecting from a slew of therapeutics. Organ failure is brought on by years of damage and even though organ decline can be stayed off temporarily by therapeutic intervention, a failing organ means patients have a few years to months before a replacement is necessary. But the holy grail of tissue engineering, engineered vascular organs will begin transplant studies within the next decade. Currently, animal models act as poor surrogates for testing of human targeted therapeutics. On the way to providing full human organs and tissues small human tissues that act as surrogates for 3D human tissues are poised to yield better drug pipeline candidates through more accurate preclinical testing and screening. In 1959 two distinct types of diabetes were characterized (Type I and Type II) and in early 2018 a report detailed that Type II Diabetes appears to be 5 distinct diseases, including a late-stage autoimmune version striking people in their thirties. Over the next decade the medical field will shift away from symptomatology and towards etiological genetic-based diagnosis. Combine genetic diagnosis with AI analysis of genetic patterns, disease presentation, and clinical outcome data, and look for reduced waste in superfluous treatments, improved outcomes, and an increased interest in targeted therapeutic interventions. 2019–2029: The Next Decade Streamlining drug development processes by adopting tech approaches and applying complex data analysis is going to drive significant changes over the next decade of biomedical research. From AI in medicine to cells as long-lived therapeutics the aging baby boomer generation will assist in driving these changes. The ability to manipulate cells, data, and perhaps the ability to build life itself is now poised to move toward unprecedented mastery over human disease in the next 10 years.",SCIENCE
"  I’ve read over 300 books since the beginning of 2011, not counting the many I started but didn’t finish and the endless content we all read online. I’ve read about topics ranging from Buddhism to business, philosophy to physics, and writers ranging from feminists to pick-up artists (and even Trump’s “Art of The Deal.”) I’ve read old books, new books, books with illustrations and fancy charts, a lot of books from which I got nothing and a handful of books I still love. Here’s what I’ve learned in all that reading time — and some of my favorite books from my 20’s. My least favorite books are what I call “bullshit business books” — the theoretical fluff written by people who have never directly done the thing. They’re professors, or “entrepreneurs” of nothing, or heads of “organizations,” and they make it their business to compile all the notes they’ve seen from other people’s actual businesses and pawn it off as “expertise,” like some armchair anthropologist reporting on “life in the Congo” because he visited once, so now he “knows.” In other words: most of the shit sold in airport book stores. I read a truly unfortunate number of these books before I got fed up enough to swear them off forever, like dumping that big-talk lover who promises you the moon but just leaves dirty laundry everywhere. And then we get people who are only trying to be successful — and maybe even making a business out of talking about “success”— and they take up reading because they hear it’s clutch, and then regurgitate it on down the chain. I’m not saying successful people don’t read — many of them do, I’m sure, and they might even chalk their success up this, in part. I had read dozens of books on marketing and entrepreneurship and customer segmentation and sales and product and design and everything else under the sun. And you’ll get a lot farther bumping along on your own without any books than you ever will reading and not actually doing anything else. Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk wrote a fantastic piece on this, pointing out: From books for healing to engineering books to resolve a design question, books are an excellent resource for specific questions My favorite book last year was The Will To Change (hooks) because I was coming off a breakup. Otherwise it becomes, as one cofounder of two companies once put it, “an academic exercise.” My favorite types of books are autobiographies and memoirs from people I admire — with top slots going to Zero to One (Thiel), Big Magic(Gilbert), Fashion is Spinach (Hawes), The Hard Thing About Hard Things(Horowitz), and Man’s Search for Meaning (Frankl), and honorable mentions going to all of the dozens of autobiographical pieces I’ve read (Vaynerchuk included.) Some of my favorite non-autobiographical pieces are still-solid firsthand thought pieces like Rework (and pretty much any thing else Fried and/or Hansson put out) and The Law of Success (Hill), the latter of which includes a chapter on leadership that is by far one of my favorite pieces on management philosophy. As an aside: the only few pieces I hold in the same tier as firsthand accounts are well-researched and rich books on the human mind, such as Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (Csikszentmihalyi) and Blink (Gladwell). Maybe we’d eventually like a certain book, but we’re just “not ready for it,” or right now’s not the right time. When I first tried to wander in through its unlocked side door in my early 20’s, I felt like I’d walked into the middle of a heated debate with big words and no context — and philosophy isn’t a conversation where many are willing to pause to get you up to speed. There are feminist writers, there are man-hating writers, and there are self-sabotaging writers who use big words like “strong women” while simultaneously cutting themselves down with the task of “winning a man.” You can find angry writers, sexist writers, delusional writers, depressed writers, writers from all walks of life. And we have to remember this while reading, especially when we’re looking for “answers to questions” and already have an idea of what answer we want. One of my dear friends became enraptured with Rupi Kaur’s Milk and Honey,and recommended it to me with that zeal with which we always throw beloved books at other people. I read through half a dozen pieces and, much to the disappointment I could see fill her previously-eager eyes, they just didn’t do anything for me. Because this is always the first question people ask (even after I tell them that reading is personal and it depends on what you’re looking for, see above.)",LIFE
"  Most people’s lives are a reflection of their past, rather than their future. According to several psychologists, the foundation of all fears is the “unknown.” We want our lives to be predictable. Trying something new and attempting to change your life will, without a doubt, cause anxiety. Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.” In order to move forward in your life, you’ll need to embrace difficulty and uncertainty — or what you might typically consider “anxiety” which Kierkegaard called the “dizziness” of freedom. And according to Albert Einstein, “The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.” The only way to change is to stop explaining your life by your past and to start explaining your life based on your future. You get to design your life and your future. If you really want to get healthy, then you probably can’t eat today what you ate yesterday. Rather than repeating the behavior of your past, you need to act today based on the life you want to have tomorrow. If you wait for tomorrow to start acting how you should today, then you really are just repeating yesterday. As Professor Harold Hill has said — “You pile up enough tomorrows, and you’ll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.” You cannot have confidence in your life without positively moving forward toward a bigger and better future. If you’re days, weeks, and years are a repeating of the past, then you’re not confident. Living a comfortable and predictable life is actually a clear reflection of your lack of confidence. You can only have confidence after you’ve begun living a better life — and then, that confidence allows you to think bigger about what is possible. The purpose of a morning routine is to get yourself moving toward your grand and exciting future. If you don’t have an exciting future that you’re working toward, then you are literally stuck in the past. And when stuck in the past, you cannot change your life, but only repeat the patterns that got you here. When you start the day in a higher and more powerful way, you’ll immediately begin turning your future a different direction from your past. With this short morning routine, your life will quickly change. But in short, it’s really quite simple: Let’s begin: The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) conducted surveys revealing that at least 40 million Americans suffer from over 70 different sleep disorders. In addition, more than 40 percent of adults experience daytime sleepiness severe enough to interfere with their daily activities at least a few days each month — with 20 percent reporting problem sleepiness a few days a week or more. On the flip side, getting a healthy amount of sleep is linked to: The very act of waking up earlier will create an enormous sense of motivation in your life. You can’t be motivated without taking positive steps forward toward a desired future. As Harvard psychologist, Jerome Bruner said, “You’re more likely to act yourself into feeling than feeling yourself into action.” Waking up early has the power of making you “psychologically bulletproof.” If you wake up early and — rather than getting sucked into the distraction of your smartphone or the addiction to stimulants — you start vividly imagining your desired future and boldly acting toward that future, then your life will quickly change. Motivation is something you must create every day. If you start every morning putting yourself in a space of gratitude and clarity, you will attract the best the world has to offer, and not get distracted. As you write your dreams down every single day, write down the ways in which you will actually achieve those dreams. As you write down your dreams and goals, the right people will start popping into your mind. You’ll need to first develop lots of personal capability yourself in order to be someone worth connecting and collaborating with. Despite endless evidence of the need for exercise, only one-third of American men and women between the ages of 25 to 64 years engage in regular physical activity according to the Center for Disease Control’s National Health Interview Survey. If you want to be among the healthy, happy, and productive people in the world, get in the habit of regular exercise. Many people go immediately to the gym to get their body moving. If you don’t care about your body, every other aspect of your life will suffer. If you courageously confront fear for 20 seconds every single day, before you know it, you’ll be in a different socio-economic and social situation. You can’t change your life without courage. As Mastin Kipp has said, “Unless you’re in mortal danger, fear is a compass showing you where to go.” You’re not rewarded in life for what you know. Instead, you’re rewarded in life for what you create. You need to find a creative outlet that allows you to build a body of work. As Seth Godin said, “If you’re willing to do something that might not work, you’re closer to becoming an artist.” Creativity is highly personal and emotional. If you wake up every day and begin doing highly creative work toward your biggest dreams and ambitions, you’ll begin living a rare and incredible life. In order to make millions of dollars and stop living the 9–5, you must become a creator. The morning time is the best time to creatively work since your brain is most creative first thing in the morning and your mind isn’t muddled by all the happenings of the day. Mark Twain once wrote, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” That quote has become a principle that many successful people apply. If you don’t do your most important work first thing in the morning, you probably will never get it done. If, however, you do eat that frog every single day, you’ll begin to see something truly magical happen in your life. You’ll begin living a creative and harmoniously passionate life. You’ll begin to create things that other people want. You’ll begin to feel more zest and passion for life. You’ll begin to dream bigger and imagine how you can turn your art into a business, such that you can make money by creating value for people in the most personal way you possibly can. Ideally, you should try to spend at least 90 minutes per morning working on a creative project that directly translates to your ideal future and the dreams you’re trying to live. It is common for the world’s most successful people to read at least one book per week. Taking even 15–30 minutes every morning to read uplifting and instructive information changes you. In addition to moving your own life forward, you’ll want to deepen the connections with those you love. Your relationships are a very clear indicator of your quality of life and character. When you invest in key relationships — both personal and professional — your life starts to change. According to Joe Polish, “Life gives to the giver and takes from the taker.” If during your mornings, you proactively do something kind, thoughtful, and useful to someone important in your life, you’ll feel far more joy. You’ll also likely make huge progress toward your goals, because the more successful you become, the more your success depends on your relationships. Because you’ll have done all these things, you’ll show up better in life. Your life will shortly change. You can’t have mornings like this consistently without waking up to all that is incongruent in your life. You follow this daily, your life will change very quickly.",LIFE
" Real love fits into real life, rather than usurping it. You fantasize long and hard enough, you can see anything in your future — like I could imagine moving to Switzerland to be a goat farmer. The problem is that we’ve made “love” into a game of escapism, and measure potential partners by how they fit into that fantasy. That’s not love. But love isn’t always wanting to. Don’t think it’s not love just because sometimes you want space. Loving isn’t “impressing.” Healthy love doesn’t involve fear of loss. It also doesn’t involve fear of “never being with another woman.” I don’t even know what that is. This is attachment again, not mature love. This is self-love, not love. But this just means that they are deserving of love. Bad: If you’re unhappy and using your partner as an oasis, then you need to get your shit together. Good: you actually care about their wants and needs, and prioritize them in a way that doesn’t tear you down Bad: you compromise your own wants and needs, or base your value on your ability to “keep them happy.” Rad for them Congrats, there may be hope for you yet. That doesn’t mean we love them. You don’t feel love. Their needs never seem irritating. You learn their love language. Because everyone thinks they’re in love when it’s clear skies and calm waters, but watch them when the storm hits. You know because you love even when you’re pissed. It’s love if you don’t “fight;” you disagree. You love if your objective is reaching an agreement, not picking a winner. You love if you don’t get defensive, insecure, or manipulative. If you don’t “take back your love” as punishment. You love if you seek to understand before being understood; listen and honor what they share — and you don’t double down with your own issues. You know because you love even when you’re hurt. Especially honoring and respecting their wants and needs even when they include “breaking up.” We like to differentiate between “being in love with” and “loving” someone. But “being in love with” is infatuation, and infatuation means nothing in getting real love. So if what you want is real love, then “how to” is all that matters. It’s love when you do it.",LIFE
" While driving back to my friend’s house, he said, “There’s no way I could’ve done a workout like that by myself.” When you think of the word, “Willpower,” do you think of “individual” or “together”? Willpower is trying to go it alone. Addiction expert and founder of Genius Recovery, Joe Polish, often says, “A person is as sick as their secrets.” In the book, THE BODY KEEPS THE SCORE, Bessel van der Kolk M.D. When a person experiences trauma, they usually keep their pain to themselves. Hence, Dr. Gabor Maté explained in a recent interview with Tim Ferriss, “Trauma isn’t what happens to you, it’s what happens inside you.” Trauma isn’t necessarily caused by tough experiences. It’s caused by keeping those experiences and the pain or confusion of those experiences to yourself. It’s caused by trying to go at it alone. Addiction therapist and researcher, Arnold M. Washton, Ph.D. said, “Many people think that what the addict needs is willpower, but nothing could be further from the truth.” Willpower is focused on the self. As Johann Hari explains in his famous TED TALK, the only way out of addiction is through connecting with other people. We often ignore the power of environment and focus on individual traits we believe are key to success: such as willpower, mindset, grit, etc. Dr. David Hawkins explains in his book, LETTING GO, “It is the illusion of individuality that is the origin of all suffering.” Most people fail to make positive change in their life because they are trying to do it all themselves. Their silent battles and attempts at willpower only suppress their pain further down. According to neuroscientist, Candace Pert, PhD, in her book, YOUR BODY IS YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND, we all have multiple personalities. When a person gets stuck in their pain and individuality, Bessel van der Kolk M.D. calls it having a “frozen personality.” Which brings up another huge myth and misconception in Western Culture: the idea that we have a fixed and static personality — one we’re born with and one we die with. When you learn to connect with other people and learn to get the help you need to heal your suppressed pain, your personality will change. Beyond that, when you learn to connect with others, you open yourself up to growth and opportunity that could never be available to you with the “lone ranger” mentality. Connection is required for going much further than you could ever go on your own. According to Harvard Psychologist, Robert Kegan, there is a 3-step model of “conscious evolution.” You don’t just have one personality. And the more holistic you can live your life, and seek connection over willpower, the more you’ll be able to overcome past traumas, and the more you’ll be able to create a much bigger future. According to Strategic Coach founder, Dan Sullivan, when two people come together who are living in their “unique ability,” they can go 100X bigger in their goals. As Stephen Covey explains in 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Are you fighting silent battles? If you’re ready, you’ll surround yourself with other people who will help you go far beyond what you could ever do on your own. As Helen Keller said, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.” Similarly, Jim Rohn said, “Don’t join an easy crowd; you won’t grow.",LIFE

The interesting thing is that you can replace the object of desire (car) with any other noun (a new house, a new job, a new relationship, etc. Shifting and swapping the contents of your box may briefly alter the shape of it in the form of excitement, but in the end, these things will become just another part of normal life. So if moving around the contents of the box doesn’t work, you look to the supposed root of the problem: The box itself. You decide that the box known as your environment needs to be left behind because it is the source of perpetual discontentment to begin with. You need to rip open the box and jettison yourself into an unfamiliar territory that holds the key to true novelty and sustained wonderment. So you save up some money, take some time off work, pack up your bags, and head off to a country you’ve never been to. You can now revel in the beauty of the unfamiliar and immerse yourself in a boundless expanse of culture, cuisine, and life that your box has never known. A vacation is designed to be an exciting respite we take to keep us incentivized to return back to The Box of Daily Experience upon its conclusion. In a way, it’s absurdly paradoxical — churning the gears of the box is what provides us with the fiscal resources to break out of it, but the wonderful memories of our vacations are what brings us squarely back to the box once again. As a result, if you’re traveling as a form of vacation, you know you will be back in your box very, very shortly. It’s times like these when you begin to dream of getting out of The Box of Daily Experience for good. You realize that a vacation only serves as a dopamine hit of cultural experience, as the built-in time constraints don’t allow you to truly understand the tapestry of a foreign place. And one day, you firmly decide that the answer does not reside in the box you live in now. These new folks have a deep understanding of a culture you’re eager to learn more about, so every hang out session with them is an opportunity to do things you’ve never done before. But remember, since you are going to be staying here for a while, having fun with interesting people and seeing new sights are not reliable roadmaps for financial sustainability. And plus, all of your friends are busy in the daytime with work, and being a lone wanderer in the early afternoon is only fun for so long. The nature of the work is pretty similar to what you were doing in the past — it’s not ideal, but it supports your dream of traveling and breaking out of the old box, so it’s good enough. You now have a resource-producing engine that can power your stay in your new home, and you can continue having great experiences in this land as time progresses. As the days in this foreign country turn into weeks, the experiences begin to occur with a familiar sense of regularity. The food that you excitedly ate when you first arrived has now become your weekday dinner spot: The friends that showed you all those cool cultural things when you first arrived are now people you see every week. On top of that, you often hang out at the same places all the time as well: The sights you initially paid to go see simply become buildings you pass by on the way to work: The job you have here feels just like your job back home again. And speaking of home, you begin to wonder how your friends are doing, as these are the folks that have been with you through years of shared experiences, and not through weeks of short-lived moments. And without consciously realizing it yet, your life events are sequencing themselves into a familiar order… One that you tried so desperately to escape not too long ago. The Box of Daily Experience has contained you once again. Since The Box of Daily Experience has returned, the subsequent urge to break out of it has come back as well. You can change your external environment all you want, but you will continue to travel with the one box that will always accompany you. When we are obsessed with travel, we are intently focused on changing and revising our external venue while neglecting the one constant we all travel with: our minds. That point can be delayed through novel experiences, but regardless of where you are, an uneasy mind will always unveil itself in the end. A strained relationship with your family, a sense of purposelessness in work, a low self-worth, a strong tension with your partner, a lurking depression — the answer to any of these things does not lie in a one-way ticket to a faraway place. Socrates said it best: We tend to grossly overestimate the pleasure brought forth by new experiences and underestimate the power of finding meaning in current ones. The Box of Daily Experience. Instead of viewing this box as a problem to escape, we have to realize that it is indeed the only thing that we can truly hold onto. When you view life as a continuous cycle in this box, it can be easy to take its components for granted and view everything as a mundane blur of familiar events. However, when you take the time to actually inspect the box with mindful awareness of its contents, you will discover the true amazement that lives within them. Gratitude is what allows you to feel that same sense of wonderment about your day-to-day life as you would if you were walking the streets of a faraway city. Gratitude is what illuminates the fact that you are a collection of (billions of) atoms that have come together to create this amazing combination of cells, neurons, and organs that allow you to touch things, taste delicious food, go hiking, laugh at funny jokes, and view the stars in a nighttime sky. Gratitude is what allows you to realize that everyone you know and love also happens to be this collection of atoms that have assembled themselves at this precise point in time, when they could have been born thousands of years earlier or hundreds of years later. It is the starting point for an endless list of awesome things we have going for us, and we don’t need to change our physical location one bit to witness this list grow. If gratitude is the tool we use to highlight the innate beauty existing within our boxes, then practices such as mindfulness meditation allows these realizations to actually become a part of our daily outlook. One of the difficult things about the routines embedded in our daily experience is that they tend to congeal into one giant, uniform blob that we label as “life.” And this blob can harden over time to create an impenetrable barrier that prevents us from absorbing helpful advice and realizations that come to light. What we are left with is clarity and openness to see The Box of Daily Experience for what it really is: a reflection of life that can be eased into fluidity with the proper attention and care. While clarity of experience is a direct path to the calming of the mind, there is another beautiful quality to our consciousness that is often overlooked. Instead of searching for inspiring experiences in faraway places, these awesome things are abundantly available to us at all times. It’s amazing to me that as an ordinary person, I have immediate access to the greatest minds of the past and present, and can absorb years and years of their toiling research in just a matter of days or weeks. This ability to be captivated by the minds of others is also widely available in the form of our loved ones and friends. The key is not to discard The Box of Daily Experience and find a new one — it’s to warmly embrace the one that we have now — with its joys, its flaws, and everything in between.

"  For the longest time, I believed that there’s only purpose of life: And that is to be happy. In fact, if you look around you, most people are pursuing happiness in their lives. That’s why we collectively buy shit we don’t need, go to bed with people we don’t love, and try to work hard to get approval of people we don’t like. All I know is that it has something to do with history, culture, media, economy, psychology, politics, the information era, and you name it. Most people love to analyze why people are not happy or don’t live fulfilling lives. Just a few short years ago, I did everything to chase happiness. But at the end of the day, you’re lying in your bed (alone or next to your spouse), and you think: “What’s next in this endless pursuit of happiness?” Well, I can tell you what’s next: You, chasing something random that you believe makes you happy. Because when you read it, you think that happiness is the main goal. I believe that happiness is merely a byproduct of usefulness. When I talk about this concept with friends, family, and colleagues, I always find it difficult to put this into words. Most things we do in life are just activities and experiences. I love to go on holiday, or go shopping sometimes. What really makes me happy is when I’m useful. When I create something that others can use. Or even when I create something I can use. For the longest time I found it difficult to explain the concept of usefulness and happiness. Emerson says: And I didn’t get that before I became more conscious of what I’m doing with my life. Did you do useful things in your lifetime? You can make up your own useful activities. But when you do little useful things every day, it adds up to a life that is well lived. In the book, he writes about how he lived his life and how he found his calling. Another person who always makes himself useful is Casey Neistat. I’ve been following him for a year and a half now, and every time I watch his YouTube show, he’s doing something. He also talks about how he always wants to do and create something. He even has a tattoo on his forearm that says “Do More.” Most people would say, “why would you work more?” And then they turn on Netflix and watch back to back episodes of Daredevil. For you it can be painting, creating a product, helping elderly, or anything you feel like doing. Just DO something that’s useful. I’ve made an eBook with 5 tips, exercises, and video training, that you can use to get immediate results. There’s one question at the core of my work: How can we live a useful life that matters? http://dariusforoux.com/ Articles on productivity, habits, decision making, and personal finance.",LIFE
"  Recently Amit, a friend of mine, quit his job at a consulting firm. Amit had been outstanding not just as a consultant but also a team player. He bagged a few new clients for the firm even though he didn’t get a commission. In less than 24 hours, Amit’s email access was revoked and he was removed from the Instant Messaging group (they had never been half as quick to give him support when he needed it). Things began to sour between the firm and some of Amit’s clients because the consultants who took up the projects were not capable enough. But within the firm, word spread that these issues were Amit’s fault. We would’ve expected people tell us how things are falling apart without us, not blame us for others’ incompetence. We wait for friends we stop hanging out with to tell us how much they miss us. We wait for our ex to text or call and tell us how miserable they are without us. It becomes difficult to digest the fact that they can have fun without us. While waiting for their lives to turn miserable without us, we make our lives miserable. The deeper our attachment, the more effort we put into it without pausing to assess our level of control in the situation. But the harder we try to control something we cannot, the more we set ourselves up for disappointment and misery. Amit has an enviable attitude because he embodies both these principles. Not even your body, because you cannot control whether you’ll fall sick or injure yourself. Amit told me that fussing over what people thought of him was outside his locus of control. Instead, he immediately directed his energy into things that were in his control. He doesn’t want to commit the mistakes he saw the consulting firm and his clients make. While happiness can come from feeling good when others validate us, meaning comes from contributing to others or to society in a bigger way. Happiness that comes from external validation disappears just as quickly. But pursuing something that adds meaning to our lives always leads to long-lasting happiness. Let it be something that makes you feel satisfied at the end of the day even if the results are not in your favor, something that makes you look forward to the next day. To help others lead a better life, you must start with the person in the mirror.

See me in black, matched to your perfect white,See me in quotation marks like reported speech: almost yours but not quite.See me stand for something, but there is something more,See me fall at your feet, I finally learned to love my flaws.

" For too long we have neglected the intuitive, emotional wisdom of the subconscious, a treasury of deep knowledge that cannot be explained using plain words but must instead be told, as our ancestors did, through old stories and mythologies. It was Carl Jung who proposed that the human mind, or psyche, is not exclusively the product of personal experience, but rather contains elements which are universal and common to all. These elements he called the archetypes and he concluded that it is their influence on human thought and behaviour that gives rise to the similarities between the myths and religions of different cultures. These archetypes reveal the presence of a universal memory belonging to man whereby elements of human history have fused and advanced to form the human psyche. In this sense, archetypes represent the human psychological characteristics that are transpersonal, indigenous and inherited. They found that past expressions of kingship all pointed towards archetypal structures that belong within the collective masculine unconscious. These images and archetypes serve as a reflection into the unconscious of the masculine; they allow us to understand the patterns of life that have happened since the beginning of human history. And, by looking into these patterns, Moore believed, we can learn how to orient our masculinity according to the highest of ideals. Moore argued that the problems we see with men today–violence, shiftlessness, aloofness–are a result of modern men not adequately exploring or being in touch with the primal, masculine archetypes that reside within them. For there is no single standard for being a man, no code or definition that one must follow to become masculine. Masculinity is already within us and we express its energy with our heart and soul. But, nevertheless, these archetypes will resonate with both sexes and are essential if both wish to develop their masculine energy. Moore named the archetypes of the masculine the Warrior, the Magician, the Lover and the King. These archetypes exist within each man, but some of them will resonate more than others according to the expression of the soul. The Warrior uses his energy to face threats of violence from outside and threats of chaos from within. The Magician is grounded and present; he draws energy from his body rather than the commotion of his mind, allowing his senses to enjoy the natural flow of the world. His heart is open to the spirit of the world and he seeks to experience as many dimensions of life as possible, as often as possible. This is the archetype that fuels a man’s spirituality, and the one in which the energy of love resides. Those flashes of inspiration or sparks of creativity we feel within ourselves, this is the Lover’s energy displaying itself in our lives. A man in tune with his Lover will allow himself to feel happiness and pain, to fall in love and pursue boundless freedom without limitations or fear. A man who accesses the King archetype in its fullness will also have access to the Warrior, Magician, and Lover archetypes. The King is a balance of the other archetypes; he directs and orders these images so that he can become a divine channel of goodness to those around him. And so, the King serves as the divine messenger and the earthly commander of God’s true spoken words. The purpose of Kingship, then, is to elevate the other archetypes to maturity and fullness. But without the energy of the King, the other three columns become weak and brittle: Notice also that there is a significant element of femininity within the King energy. The most consistent ideal within the mythologies is the balance of the masculine and the feminine, of the mind and the body, of consciousness and emotion — the wholeness of the universe itself. The kings of the Anglo-Saxons, the Persians, and the Indians were all presented as battle-hardened soldiers and creative masters with the destructive might of nature, but they were also viewed as high priests with divine ancestry and nurturers of their people. But if the world is poisoned, it is no surprise that men have become poisoned also. Brutalised children, born from cruel or absent parents, who are not taught how to deal with the conflict between their unconscious and their emerging conscious will become, in one way or another, brutal adults. They will not be able to maturely express their masculinity and will never outgrow the self-centered and egoistic impulses of the child, remaining a prey for the shadows of the soul— for they are merely boys pretending to be men. Alternatively, a man who is out of touch with the Lover will be an impotent Lover, one who is never able to enjoy the dance with the feminine. This shadow type is particularly destructive when involved in romantic relationships since the man or woman, usually a man, will try to control the other using all kinds of schemes and tricks. On the other hand, people who deny the Magician within them are either those who think they know everything or those who pretend not to understand anything at all. If a man stifles the King within him, he will refuse to take control of his life, he will never ground himself to the present moment, nor will he embrace his true gifts and knowledge. Other people will be able to see his insincerity; they see his immense potential, they see his power, but they also see how he cowers behind others and never accepts responsibility for his purpose. However, those who deny the energy usually have immense quantities of it within them that they refuse to admit. These emotional wounds will gradually reveal their presence during adolescence and then they remain fixed in adulthood, often deciding which of the archetypes the man will grow to associate with most. If we repress our wounds into the unconscious and deny them within ourselves, we become victims to shadow possession. This is the premise that was the foundation of Carl Jung’s work: Every man, whether he admits it or not, will be able to feel one or more of the shadow archetypes within themselves. But when one judges and resists the energy, it becomes perverted and ungrounded. For example, if one resists his Warrior because he has come to view himself as a harmless and innocent bystander, which is often the case when one has grown up with overprotective parents, then the instinctive desire to impose his will becomes crooked and dangerous — he has judged his natural aggression to be sinister and immoral. To achieve fullness, this person must realign himself with the natural masculine desire to thrust oneself into the world. The people in our lives will also become less repulsive and more human. And if we become aware of these patterns and the symbols they manifest, we experience an expansion of consciousness. And by rediscovering the archetypes of man and the wisdom of our ancestors, we will be able to heal the health and reputation of masculinity.",LIFE
"  There’s a routine question asked in job interviews, first dates, table games and so on: What is the most important thing you look for in other people? “What’s the most attractive quality you look for in a potential partner?” Or, “What’s your greatest strength?” And so on) but, in general, the answer remains the same: The character trait you hold above all. When pressed, I’ve often stumbled and resorted to something trite and probably not true: honesty, humor, confidence, charisma, etc. And so one day I sat down on my pleather couch, brewed some holy basil tea, queued up some Anderson Paak on the Spotify and really, truly tried to whittle down the essence of what makes truly admirable, special people exactly that. I analyzed people I looked up to, people I was attracted to, and people I just couldn’t dream to be without. And I found that the answer could never be just one thing, and that many of the things I think I admire are manifestations of other, deeper things I admire more. Here are the three components that, when taken together, create a spellbinding supernova of a person — one who can command a room and control their destiny, one who can be both altruistic and intelligent. It’s the belief that you are not yet so great that your mind cannot be opened, and it’s the presence of mind to remember that we are all interconnected equals, and that injustice against one is an injustice against all. People who exhibit humility let their work speak for itself, they remain stoic in the face of their own suffering, and they remind themselves — and others — that life is fragile and therefore valuable. People who exhibit curiosity can become masters, or polymaths, or auteurs — but they must first always have an open mind. I want people around me to remain curious, routinely examining the world through fresh eyes, and using their eyes to find fresh corners of the world. Empathy brings people closer, and makes others feel understood and less alone inside. And if there is one thing we’re all looking to become a little less of, it’s alone. When I see truly empathetic people, I see people who genuinely care, but also people who remind us that sometimes it’s okay to be still with someone else and not invade their space or encroach their boundaries. This unique ability to understand the world through others’ eyes and cut to the heart of what others are feeling and experiencing. In fact, when you stack humility, curiosity and empathy, you can easily see how they amplify each other. And if you take any two without the third, you’re missing a crucial component: Humble, curious, apathetic people are slothful. Humble, disaffected, empathetic people are sensitive but not very interesting. Brash, curious, empathetic people are exhausting.",LIFE
" But whatever generation is doing it, whether they’re written by scribes in China or commoners in some European dungeon or simply passed along by a kindly grandfather, these little epigrams of life advice have taught essential lessons. “What is an epigram?” Coleridge asked, “A dwarfish whole; Its body brevity, and wit its soul.” Epigrams are what Churchill was doing when he said: “To improve is to change, so to be perfect is to have changed often.” Or Balzac: “All happiness depends on courage and work.” Ah yes, epigrams are often funny too. Napoleon: “Never interrupt an enemy making a mistake.” François de La Rochefoucauld: “We hardly find any persons of good sense save those who agree with us.” Voltaire: “A long dispute means that both parties are wrong.” Below are some wonderful epigrams that span some 21 centuries and 3 continents. Each one is worth remembering, having queued in your brain for one of life’s crossroads or to drop at the perfect moment in conversation. Each will change and evolve with you as you evolve (Heraclitus: “No man steps in the same river twice”) and yet each will remain strong and unyielding no matter how much you may one day try to wiggle out and away from them. Fundamentally, each one will teach you how to be a better person. At the beginning of his life, few would have predicted that Theodore Roosevelt even had a choice in the matter. “I will make my body,” he said, when told that he would not go far in this world with a brilliant mind in a frail body. What followed was a montage of boxing, hiking, horseback riding, hunting, fishing, swimming, boldly charging enemy fire, and then a grueling work pace as one of the most prolific and admired presidents in American history. Back in America he contracted a severe throat infection and was later diagnosed with inflammatory rheumatism, which temporarily confined him to a wheelchair (saying famously, “All right! But there is not a person on the planet who would say that he had not made a fair trade, that he had not worn his life well and not lived a full one in those 60 years. One follows in his father’s footsteps and ends up struggling through life as a drunk, and the other becomes a successful, sober businessman. Each are asked: “Why are you the way you are?” The answer for both is the same: “Well, it’s because my father was an alcoholic.” The same event, the same childhood, two different outcomes. The Stoics — of which Epictetus was one — would say that we don’t control what happens to us, all we control are our thoughts and reactions to what happens to us. Remember that: You’re defined in this life not by your good luck or your bad luck, but your reaction to those strokes of fortune. Because revenge is so costly, because the pursuit of it often wears on the one who covets it. Marcus’s advice is easier and truer: How much better it feels to let it go, to leave the wrongdoer to their wrongdoing. When Avidius Cassius, one of his most trusted generals rebelled and declared himself emperor, Marcus did not seek vengeance. Instead, he saw this as an opportunity to teach the Roman people and the Roman Senate about how to deal with civil strife in a compassionate, forgiving way. This is very different than the idea of “Living well being the best revenge” — it’s not about showing someone up or rubbing your success in their face. Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of the classic series Little House, lived this, facing some of the toughest and unwelcoming elements on the planet: harsh and unyielding soil, Indian territory, Kansas prairies, and the humid backwoods of Florida. Everywhere was a chance to do something new, to persevere with cheery pioneer spirit whatever fate befell her and her husband. In the hiring process, most employers look at where someone went to school, what jobs they’ve held in the past. When you seek to advance your own position in life, character is the best lever — perhaps not in the short term, but certainly over the long term. A man shows up for work at a company where he knows that management is doing something wrong, something unethical. Can he cash his checks in good conscience because he isn’t the one running up the stock price, falsifying reports or lying to his co-workers? One cannot, as Budd Schulberg says in one of his novels, deal in filth without becoming the thing he touches. After discovering numerous problems at the health care startup, he was dismissed by his seniors and eventually contacted the authorities. Afterwards, not only was this young man repeatedly threatened, bullied, and attacked by Theranos, but his family had to consider selling their house to pay for the legal bills. As Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, and us: “Just that you do the right thing. Everyone is better than you at something. Someone is better than you at making eye contact. Someone is better than you at quantum physics. Someone is better informed than you on geopolitics. Someone is better than you are at speaking kindly to someone they dislike. There are better gift-givers, name-rememberers, weight-lifters, temper-controllers, confidence-carriers, and friendship-makers. There is no one person who is the best at all these things, who doesn’t have room to improve in one or more of them. So if you can find the humility to accept this about yourself, what you will realize is that the world is one giant classroom. It has a way of dropping things into our lap — the consequences of an employee’s negligence, a spouse’s momentary lapse of judgement, a freak weather event — that were in no way our fault but by nature of being in our lap, our f*cking problem. Or are you just going to get to work solving it the best you can? Today, in a society obsessed with content, outrage, and drama, it’s even easier to get lost in the echo chamber of the debate of what’s “better.” We can have endless discussions about what’s right and wrong. Stop wasting time with how things should be, would be, could be. “Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.” “Ambition,” Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, “means tying your well-being to what other people say or do . A lot has been said of so-called “F*ck You Money.” The idea being that if one can earn enough, become rich and powerful enough, that suddenly no one can touch them and they can do whatever they want. How often the target seems to mysteriously move right as we approach it. It calls to mind the observation of David “DHH” Heinemeier Hansson who said that “beyond a specific amount, f*ck-you money can be a state of mind. One that you can acquire well in advance of the corresponding bank account. One that’s founded mostly on a personal confidence that even if most of the material trappings went away, you’d still be happier for standing your ground.” The truth is being your own man, being self-contained, having fewer needs, and better, resilient skills that allow you to thrive in any and all situations. It was one of the great Stoics who said that if you live with a lame man, soon enough you will walk with a limp. My father told me something similar as a kid: “You become like your friends.” It is true not just with social influences but informational ones too: If you are addicted to the chatter of the news, you will soon find yourself worried, resentful, and perpetually outraged. If all you do is watch the markets and obsess over every fluctuation, your worldview will become defined by money and gains and losses. You can always get up after you fall, but remember, what has been said can never be unsaid. One can never go back in time to prepare for what they should have prepared for, no one can ever get back critical seconds that were wasted out of fear or ego. And it is only much much later, as they are on their deathbeds or when they are looking back on what might have been, that many people realize the awful truth of this quote. The problem with comparing yourself to other people is you really never know anyone else’s situation. People do a very good job pretending at things, and their well-maintained fronts are often covers for incredible risk and irresponsibility. You never know, Warren Buffett was saying, until things get bad. If you’re living the life you know to be right, if you are making good, solid decisions, don’t be swayed by what others are doing — whether that is taking the form of irrational exuberance or panicked pessimism. (Premeditatio Malorum) Marcus Aurelius would say something similar: “Be tolerant with others and strict with yourself.” Why? It’s a complete waste of time to go around projecting strict standards on other people — ones they never agreed to follow in the first place — and then being aghast or feel wronged when they fall short. What if they were working hard to recommit themselves to their family and as much as they’d like to have coffee with you, are doing their best to spend more time with their loved ones? Ah, the way that a good one liner can humble even the world’s greatest conqueror. What Juvenal reminds us is the same thing that Shakespeare spoke about in Hamlet: It doesn’t matter how famous you are, how powerful you are, how much you think you have left to do on this planet, the same thing happens to all of us, and it can happen when we least expect it. While this is probably not a Churchill original (he most likely borrowed from Cardinal Newman: “In a higher world it is otherwise, but here below to live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often”), Churchill certainly abided this in his life. He’d even quip about his constant change of political affiliation: “I said a lot of stupid things when I worked with the Conservative Party, and I left it because I did not want to go on saying stupid things.” As Cicero would say when attacked that he was changing his opinion: “If something strikes me as probable, I say it; and that is how, unlike everyone else, I remain a free agent.” There is nothing more impressive — intellectually or otherwise — than to change long held beliefs, opinions, and habits. Not only here would Jesus call us on one of our worst tendencies but immediately also ask: “And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye?” This line is similar to what the Stoic philosopher Seneca, who historical sources suggest was born the same year as Jesus, would say: “You look at the pimples of others when you yourselves are covered with a mass of sores.” Waste no time judging and worrying about other people. In real life, Kutuzov gave Napoleon a painful lesson in the truth of the epigram over a long winter in Russia in 1812. Tolstoy would also say, “Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.” When it comes to accomplishing anything significant, you are required to exhibit patience and fortitude, so much patience, as much as you’d think you’d need boldness and courage. In my book Conspiracy, about Peter Thiel’s plot to destroy Gawker, his operative describes a similar idea: With enough time and patience, you can do anything. Will we wait for someone to save us, or will we listen to Marcus Aurelius’s empowering call to “get active in your own rescue — if you care for yourself at all — and do it while you can.” Because at some point, we must put articles like this one aside and take action. Who knows how much time you have left, or what awaits us tomorrow?",LIFE

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson To me, practical philosophy has always been the art knowing what to — and what not to — give a fuck about. Be careful, as Marcus Aurelius warns, not to give the little things more time and thought they deserved. If so, let 2018 be a year that you only devote energy to things that truly matter — get the important things right by ignoring the insignificant. The Way to Love: The Last Meditations of Anthony de Mello by Anthony de Mello Coach Shaka Smart recommended this little book (and it’s a little book, probably the smallest I’ve ever read. Written by a Catholic Priest who’d lived in India, the book has this unusual convergence of eastern and western thought. But What If We’re Wrong by Chuck Klosterman It’s always good to remind ourselves that almost everything we’re certain about will probably be eventually proven wrong. Whether you think it’s going to be a year of radical change for the better or a horrible year of excesses of dangerous precedent, you’re probably wrong. This book shows you why, not with lectures about politics, but with a bunch of awesome thought experiments about music, books, movies and science. Rules for Radicals: A Practical Primer for Realistic Radicals by Saul Alinsky If Hillary Clinton had remembered the lessons of Saul Alinsky (who she wrote her college thesis on), the election may have turned out differently. Whatever you set out to do in 2018, this book can provide you with strategic guidance and insight. The Filter Bubble by Eli Pariser / Trust Me I’m Lying by Ryan Holiday / The Brass Check by Upton Sinclair I strongly recommend that you take the time in 2018 to read these books. I used that book as a model for my expose of the media system, Trust Me, I’m Lying. But if you read Robert’s books, I promise you will leave not just with actionable lessons but an indelible sense of what to do in many trying and confusing situations. Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue by Ryan Holiday — If you want to immerse yourself in the above topics of media and strategy, and are looking for one book to teach you lessons in both, my book on the nearly decade-long conspiracy that billionaire Peter Thiel waged against Gawker will do this for you. The Road To Character by David Brooks When General Stanley McChrystal was asked on the Tim Ferriss podcastwhat was a recent purchase that had most positively impacted his life, he pointed to this book. It can be a bit stilted and dense at times, but it should be assigned reading to any young person today (a little challenge is a good thing). Illustrating with examples and stories from great men and women, Brooks admonishes the reader to undertake their own journey of character perfection. In my own book, I explore the same topic (humility) from a different angle using similar stories — I’m attacking ego, he’s building up character. The Dip by Seth Godin This book is a short 70 pages and it looks like something someone would give as a joke gift, but it’s anything but. Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by J. D. Vance / Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right by Arlie Russell Hochschild You might describe Hillbilly Elegy as a Ta-Nehisi Coates style memoir about a community that — at least in progressive circles — gets a lot less attention: disaffected, impoverished whites (particularly in the mid-east and South). I thought the book was empathetic, self-aware and inspiring. The author pokes some holes in the concept of “white privilege” — certainly a third or fourth generation hillbilly in Kentucky doesn’t walk around feeling like they have it easy — and an explanation of some of the phenomenon behind Donald Trump (notice I said explanation, not an excuse). It Can’t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis This book is one that will make you so uncomfortable that you’ll probably pick it up and put it down several times. But no, in fact, one of America’s most famous writers wrote a bestselling book about an appalling populist demagogue who won the presidency of the United States. If you don’t read the book, at least please read about it. How to Live: Or A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer by Sarah Bakewell The book is spectacular. The format of the book is a bit unusual, instead of chapters it is made up of 20 Montaigne style essays that discuss the man from a variety of different perspectives. Montaigne was a man obsessed with figuring himself out — why he thought the way he did, how he could find happiness, his fetishes, his near-death experiences. Given the divisiveness that we are facing as a society — that became painfully clear in 2016 — this is one of the most urgent and important book you need to read next year. The Years of Lyndon Johnson (4 Volumes) by Robert A. Caro In January of 2016, I picked up my first book in this Caro’s series on Lyndon Johnson. It wasn’t until June that I finished my fourth, but I consider finishing all (~3,500 pages) of them to be one of my proudest reading achievements. It’s also easy to be disillusioned by politics right now but for me, getting lost in these Lyndon Johnson books has been a helpful and educational process. Because you learn two things 1) that things have always been complicated and confusing but they tend to turn out alright 2) that our system, whatever its flaws, can still produce good results from bad men. The scenes in this book: warning about the looming threat of Nazism, the retreat at Dunkirk, persevering through the Blitz, vowing to fight on the landing grounds and the beaches and in the streets, whatever the cost may be. (If you were to only read one thing in the next year, you could do a lot worse than either of these series. They contain dozens of books within them and will teach you about so much more than just the man they are ostensibly about. Mr. Eternity by Aaron Thier / The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas These books really have nothing to do with the events of 2016 but they are long and entertaining and they will make you forget your problems for the next 12 months.

"  They’re crackling and sighing all around you. “Another day, another dollar.” “Sounds risky.” “Will you ever settle down?” These are the milquetoast mavens who bristle at the backbreaking work it takes to brim with brilliance. These are the moaners who miss the moments that don’t follow the way it’s “supposed to be.” A checklist. Wishes are dying by a soft 40-watt light flicked on in place of the flickering candle of their fleeting soul. Tame is only a letter away from lame. To wait is to slumber with one’s eyes open, blind to the beacon that lights our way to the fantastic, the mystical, the rough road that leads to the shimmering stars. Still waters are troubled by the slightest’s stone throw. Death is so imminent, so inevitable, that to breathe in the interest of breathing again is to waste a breath, when we should focus our being on being left breathless. Never let the dying of the light extinguish the flame that burns within you. Never fall for a person you’ll follow into a soft grey glow of neither black nor white nor color. Never give your heart to someone who’ll occasionally make you breakfast and treat sex like a chore. Spend your life doing amazing things with amazing people. Stillness is for the mind, but never the spirit. Wash yourself in life’s great indulgences, speak of what sparks you. Believe in the beauty of your own alchemy — the magic that can’t be charted in PowerPoint and presented to your VP of WTF.

"  The best advice I’ve ever got about reading came from a secretive movie producer and talent manager who’d sold more than 100 million albums and done more than $1B in box office returns. To do great things, you have to read to lead.” What he meant was that in an age where almost nobody reads, you can be forgiven for thinking that the simple act of picking up a book is revolutionary. Reading to lead means pushing yourself–reading books “above your level.” In short, you know the books where the words blur together and you can’t understand what’s happening? Those are the books a leader needs to read. Reading to lead or learn requires that you treat your brain like the muscle that it is–lifting the subjects with the most tension and weight. For me, that means pushing ahead into subjects you’re not familiar with and wresting with them until you can–shying away from the “easy read.” It means reading Feynman over Friedman, biographies over business books, and the classics over the contemporary. It worked wonders for me: at 19, I was a Hollywood executive, I was at 21 I was the director of marketing for a publicly traded company, and at 24 I’d worked on 5 bestselling books and sold my own to the biggest publisher in the world. I may have been a college drop out but I have had the best teachers in the world: tough books. My apartment is filled with such books that on paper, I never should have been able to understand. Tests often have very little to do with proving that you know or care about the material but more about proving that you spent the time reading it. (To write this, I had to look the names up myself, I only recalled that they started with a C) What you should latch onto is that as the two fought for allied support from Athens, one took the haughty “you owe us a favor” route and the other alluded to all the benefits that would come from aiding them. Ruin the EndingWhen I start a book, I almost always go straight to Wikipedia (or Amazon or a friend) and ruin the ending. You ought to ruin the ending–or find out the basic assertions of the book–because it frees you up to focus on your two most important tasks: The first 50 pages of the book shouldn’t be a discovery process for you; you shouldn’t be wasting your time figuring out what the author is trying to say with the book. Plus if you already know what happens, you can identify all the foreshadowing and the clues the first read through. From Amazon to the New York Times, read the reviews so you can deduce the cultural significance of the work–and from what it meant to others. It infuriates me too when what looks like a 200 page book turns out to have 80 pages of translator’s introduction, but that stuff is important. Read the intro, read all the stuff that comes before the book–even read the editors notes at the bottom of the pages. This sets the stage and helps boost your knowledge going into the book. Remember: you need every advantage you can get to read a book above your level. Look It UpIf you’re reading to lead, you’re going to come across concepts or words you’re not familiar with. I was once trying to read some books on the Civil War and got stuck. 10 hours of Ken Burn’s documentaries later, the books were easy to breeze through (see, looking stuff up can be as easy as watching TV) That being said, don’t get bogged down with the names of the cities or the spelling of names, you’re looking to grasp the meta-lesson: the conclusions. I mark every passage that interests me, that makes me think, that is important to the book. Go Back ThroughI have the same schedule with every book I read. After a mandatory 1–2 week waiting period after finishing, I go back through the book with a stack of 4×6 index cards. Read One Book from Every BibliographyThis is a little rule I try to stick with. In every book I read, I try to find my next one in its footnotes or bibliography. Last month I read a book on Evolutionary Psychology and discovered that I’d read almost 80% of its sources because I’d been pulled down the rabbit hole of a predecessor. I give you Seneca again: Remember: we read to lead for moral and practical lessons. The point is to take what we’ve read and turn the words, as Seneca says, into works. People always ask me if the books I carry around are for school because they’re full of notes, flags and folded pages–why would anyone work so hard on something they were doing on their own? It’s also expensive, I’ve purchased thousands of books and invested hours upon hours of time learning them. I think there is more wisdom in the timeless books of the last 5,000 years than a conference or two–if you do it right and push yourself. So try it: Do your research, read diligently without getting bogged down in details, and then work to connect, apply and use. And I think you’ll find that you’re able to read above your supposed “level” and that people will follow your example. If you put in the work, books, as the great writer and voracious reader Petrarch once said, will pay you back: Enjoy the journey. I’ve created a list of 15 books you’ve never heard of that will alter your worldview and help you excel at your career.",LIFE
"  The first of the three exciting facts is that “Luck” shouldn’t be part of the equation in your mind when setting a goal. When you’re thinking about something big you want to pursue, it can almost feel impossible from where you’re currently sitting. Especially if tens of thousands — or potentially even millions — of other people want the same “dream” you are wanting. I felt this way when I decided a few years ago that I wanted to become a professional writer. With literally millions of people attempting to write for a living on the internet, it seemed like luck had to be involved. The same is true of other goals I’ve since set, and goals I’m even now pursuing. When you have something HUGE you want to do, it can feel completely impossible from your current vantage point. There are only a few people TRULY doing what you want to do. That feeling is completely natural and leads us to believe LUCK is an integral part of achieving goals. A much more important FACT is that there actually is a pathway to your goal. From where you currently are to where you truly deeply want to go. And even more interesting is that the behaviors you need to DO to achieve your goals are not rocket science. There is a tangible, practical, and walkable path to achieving whatever goal you want to achieve. There is a tangible, practical, and walkable path to having deeply impactful and intimate relationships — to having whatever form of freedom or experience you want in life. Whatever it is you want, there is a path from where you are to where you want to go. What is necessary, though, is: All three of these things become increasingly clear as you begin walking your path. Indeed, all three of these things are actually feedback loops which fuel each other. Eventually, momentum and motivation take completely over and you’ll have a hard time stopping yourself from achieving your goal. You attract your goals and dreams by the person you are. In every instance, you become the person who can have the goal before achieving it. As you learn and act and move in the direction you want to go — you’ll change as a person. And you’ll wonder why so few people strive for big and amazing things in their lives. When you set a new goal — one in which you truly want — then your brain and body will immediately begin conjuring up obstacles to achieving that goal. These obstacles could be financial, time-based, skill-based, relationship-based… they could be anything. The obstacles are what you must successfully pass through in order to get to where you want to go. Passing through the obstacles is how you are transformed and changed as a person. Most people avoid hard emotions and most people evade true learning — which is the essence of passing through obstacles upward. When you face big obstacles head-on, rather than from the side or avoiding them for years, then you steepen your learning curve. Rober Brault once said, “We are kept from our goals not by obstacles, but by a clear path to lesser goals.” It’s not actually obstacles that stop you from getting from where you are to where you want to be. Instead, it is by avoiding those obstacles and by opting for an easier path with fewer obstacles. Everything you want is on the opposite side of fear and obstacles. If you’re not currently pursuing goals that challenge and excite you, then you’re not an exciting or interesting person. People who aren’t striving for something bigger have “run out of future,” in the words of Dan Sullivan. The longer a relationship exists, the more “past” there is to draw from in that relationship, and the more likely patterns are likely to occur — keeping the relationship from going to new and exciting places. Having a goal gives you something exciting to focus on. And only by pursuing a bigger future can you create different results from your past. If you’re not creating a new and exciting future, then you’re living a pattern from your past. You become more spontaneous and flexible as a person by pursuing a new and different future. What do you want your romantic relationship to look like? What do you want your environment to look like? What do you want your income to look like? What do you want your body to look like? Set goals and begin living a new and exciting future. Novelty is “NEWNESS.” Your brain literally needs you to do something new or it gets old.",LIFE
" You stare blankly at the ceiling and begin to plan your day. You’re wrapped in the same comforter, sporting the same tattered t-shirt, and your knee, the left one, still nags you until about noon. At first, this day feels like any other. The change is subtle at first, faint at best. For the first time in ages, maybe ever, a sense of clarity washes over you. You decide to no longer be misled by the barrage of Posts, Pins, and Tweets that say you can bend the world to your dreams, your timeline. A year ago, even a week, hell, the night before this would have destroyed you. You start to question the unexamined rules you’ve followed in a lifelong daze. Who got to decide these rules in the first place? Who gets to make me feel like some unperson for not carrying about the things I’ve been sold I should? You’d never claim to understand the vast subtleties, nuances, and complexities of the human condition. You know the possibilities for human potential and how to express it are nearly limitless. You’re not sure exactly, but you know it must begin small. I can do little things, but really well. Stop boasting about how little sleep I get, or how hard I hustle. I can take things less personally. Look at screens less. I can stop complaining, especially about things I don’t plan to do anything about. I can stop believing my success must come at the expense of someone else’s failure. I can smile more, look down less. I can stop following the herd. I can stop thinking I’m better than everyone. I can stop looking at my touchscreen at movies, dinner, when I’m driving, or talking with a real living breathing HUMAN. I can double-down on the facts, especially when emotions cloud my judgement. I can recognize the world does in fact have problems, big ones, but not be deluded into thinking it’s going to hell. I can stop waiting for permission to live my life. I can stop talking during movie trailers. I can stop worrying about what I can’t influence. I can remind myself to always confront the truth, however uncomfortable — especially when it’s uncomfortable. I can stop deluding myself.",LIFE
"  Society puts a lot of pressure on people in their 20s to “figure out” their lives. Here are a few things to remember as you’re navigating life in your 20s: Going “conservative” in your 20s is something you really, really should debate. The biggest reason that so many people become unhappy is that they play life in “reverse.” They go for the safe and practical job right out of school, and they buy expensive stuff to impress their parents and friends. This is exactly when you go on the “offense.” I’m a big believer in working for cheap (or free) for the person you want to try and become. Here’s what I mean by that: If you go and work for someone you admire and do an incredible job, they could “put you on” and change the course of your entire career. For example… if you admire Alex Rodriguez or Chance the Rapper and you had the chance to run their social media for $12 / hour, there’s no question that would be be better than a job that pays $52,000. Imagine what it would be like to be known as the guy or girl behind A-Rod’s social or Chance the Rapper’s videos. Be humble, patient, strategic, and stop caring what your living situation looks like to people “on the outside.” You’ll set yourself up for an incredible future. When I look for talent, I’m obsessed with finding people who love the process — not the stuff that the game “buys” you. If you’re building a business or navigating your career based on what’s going to get you the off-whites, private planes, spa treatments, or jewelry, you’re not going to have a long career. So many people in their 20s are taking jobs that pay a few thousand dollars more just so they can buy more stuff. But a lot of people are taking these jobs because they’re trying to live up to the expectations of their parents and friends. I look for people who “can’t breathe” if they’re not doing their art because those are the people who are going to win long term. It blows me away how much pressure we put on people in their 20s and early 30s to have their entire lives figured out. Now’s the time to be massively risk-oriented and try everything you want to try. Now is the time to go have different experiences and try different jobs until you find one you like. If there’s one piece of advice you take away from this article, it would be this: Have the conversations you need to have with the people you’re closest to. Tell them how you feel about everything — about what you want to do, where you want to work, your insecurities, how you feel about their expectations, and everything else. It saddens me that so many people allow the opinions of their parents and their friends to hold them back in their careers, or worse, push them to make decisions that have terrible long term consequences (like taking on massive debt). One of the biggest reasons I’m happy and can navigate my life so quickly is because I believe in one thing more than anything else: The truth will play out in the end.",LIFE
"  You can become obsessed with learning new skills and , or you can do something much smarter. A few years after purchasing this book of maps I went to visit a friend at their new house. What I needed was a new map because the old one no longer worked. Starting from a place of “Maybe I’m wrong” and doubting helps you to continuously learn new information. Think about the consequences of thinking you know something and being totally wrong. Too many of us think we know everything and that can be the cause of so much pain and unnecessary failure. We always act based on what we think we know first. The habit that is much more useful is always to assume that you don’t know first. This habit will force you to look for new information and speak with other people who might give you the advice that makes all the difference. Break the habit of thinking you know because let’s face it, you probably don’t. Doubting what you know is one thing but insisting on evidence that what you believe is still true is a much better strategy. For example, you could believe that you can run a mile in 30 seconds flat, but if the evidence suggests that it’s not possible, you’d, in fact, be trying to achieve something that is impossible and stupid at the same time. You need to have sound proof when you unlearn an old way of thinking and replace that thinking with something new. Don’t get emotional about it or try and hold onto something you learned which is no longer true. I told them ‘I don’t know.’ Later that day someone on LinkedIn asked me if they should use a business plan to quit their job and start consulting. In fact, I’ve never used a business plan and instead preferred to do user testing to validate an idea rather than a plan that’s based on my limited experience. My old view of the world was that everyone was trying to steal from me and I had to make as much money for myself as I could. We shouldn’t be afraid of change or unlearning what we know; we should be scared out of our mind about the old ideas we learned. It’s like constantly updating your internal software to make sure what you currently think is right, taking away what’s no longer relevant, and adding in new ideas and strategies that were previously undiscovered.",LIFE
" I flip-flopped on Internet dating and its meaning in my life, but eventually I quit. It was an interesting thing ignoring love for an entire year. Looking back, I realize just how much time I spent worrying about love in my life. And even though I deleted many of those stories in my purge, the theme was clear. I didn’t want anyone to take away from my focus on my children. I’ve done all that before and I didn’t want it this past year. It’s weird when you break down why you don’t want to be in a relationship and people judge you for it. That by saying you don’t want to take care of another adult in a relationship, it makes you a selfish human. But wouldn’t it be more selfish to keep going into relationships knowing you don’t have it in you? And that’s why my outlook on love has changed. It should go without saying, but if you are a hamster on the Internet dating wheel, do you realize how much time you waste swiping every month? And it wasn’t constantly being sidetracked by a new match who seduced me with, “Hey.” At some point I stopped even considering it. I listened to hundreds of podcast episodes and countless audiobooks during the time I would have been aimlessly swiping on fake profiles and the promise of a soulmate. Very few people spend their time swiping in search of intellectual stimulation and witty banter. I started to think about, for me, all the things that could come with a sexual encounter and none of it sounded good to me. And frankly, the work of building a new relationship to get to that point seemed like too much work. I started to look at sex as a complement to a good relationship and not this universal tonic that I needed to feel more like a man. I looked back at how I treated sex in relationships and other quasi-encounters and I realized that it was rarely connected to love for me. It made me think about what was more important in my future, sex or love. Most people who succeed at Internet dating play a numbers game, meaning they kiss a lot of frogs. But once I stopped trying to go on dates, I found anything and everything more interesting than the potential of a bad date. Yes, that is the very definition of not putting myself out there, but that is exactly what I wanted. Did it make me feel like my time could have been better spent sitting across from a stranger who humblebragged their profile at an OkCupid-friendly neighborhood bar? Love, or the search for it, can be a colossal time and energy suck. Sure, you hiked in 2018, but how many times did you check for new matches while you did? I didn’t even want the beautiful parts of love. I didn’t want someone around all the time. I didn’t want the cute couple things. And just because that’s how I felt in 2018, and still today, doesn’t mean love is lost on me. It means I stopped the obsessive cycle with relationships and love. I want to choose to engage in love again, but only when I am ready and only when it shows up. I don’t want to try so hard to find love because I don’t think it works that way. Because I know love is a choice and not a requirement for me, I don’t have the same urge to date. Just go out to dinner sometime and look around to see how many couples are sitting at a table together, both on their phones. Being in a relationship takes work and compromise, but when you are a single observer in the real world you get to see just how many couples don’t do the work and don’t know how to compromise. In 2018 I stopped looking for the hottest woman in line at Starbucks and started looking around at what couples looked like. The happy couples looked amazing and it made me feel an overwhelming sense of glee for them. When you look around you see a lot of unhappy couples and it makes you wonder, why are they doing it? I’ve been there many times and I never want to be there again. I stopped myself from perpetuating the never ending cycle of moving from relationship to relationship with random dates and interludes in between. My outlook on the future of love is bright.

" My biggest goal for 2018 was to give more conference talks and maybe-kinda-hopefully take a step towards becoming one of those cool, famous, Conference Speaking People. I spoke at seven conferences this past year. Preparing conference talks is, for me, an enormous time sink, nerve-racking, and all-consuming. I hyperfocused on giving great talks to the exclusion of all else, including much more fundamental life things. Yeah, much of my problem here is because I pinned too many of my hopes to conference talks, but I’m betting this is more common than anybody wants to admit. If you’re the type of person who gives or wants to give conference talks, I’m willing to bet you want to do a good job on them. I relentlessly pushed myself to make my talks as good as possible. I know you’re supposed to say you want to speak at conferences to engage with the community and share stuff that you’ve learned. But if I’m being 100% honest with myself — and I suppose you as well dear reader — those noble ambitions are not the only reasons I wanted to speak at conferences. I wanted folks to look up at me on that stage and think “wow, that guy has some food on his shirt, but he is also smart and knows his shit.” I wanted validation & recognition. I didn’t necessarily expect my employer to say “oh wow, you gave a great conference talk! I thought that maybe giving conference talks on a couple subjects would demonstrate comfortable expertise across the spectrum of front end development. Giving conference talks, engaging with the community, and positioning myself as an Authority on Things. Maybe this is particular to my employer, and every other company would have engineering managers ready to leap out of their skin at the chance to give me a raise, but I seriously doubt it. My guess would be — unless *maybe* you’re a developer 🥑 (advocate) — giving talks won’t really factor into advancement at a job. If giving conference talks doesn’t help them turn blood into dollars, your community work probably won’t be much of a factor. “Expecting a couple conference talks to assure you that you’re not a shambling moron; and expecting money to rain from the skies upon your worthy head? I knew these things wouldn’t just magically happen overnight, but I was absolutely hoping the needle would at least move in that direction. I hoped that I’d gain a bit of confidence in my abilities, have a little more self esteem, and that my employer would factor my demonstrated knowledge into a well-deserved raise. I spent an enormous amount of time preparing talks. Probably something on the order of 80–120 hours per talk; I don’t know for sure since I can’t count that high. Grinding away on them was worth the time, effort and stress, since giving great talks would pay off in better self esteem and a better situation at work. I get way too connected to my work because it’s a part of my life directly under my control. So if I can give amazing talks, then my life has value; has meaning. So I focused on my talks to the exclusion of other, much more important things. I put on weight, I drank a LOT — not to the point of alcoholism, but your concern is appreciated — I forgot to pay bills, I canceled on friends, my relationship suffered, and I basically produced no art whatsoever. I couldn’t figure out why I was so stressed out over conference things. It’s not like I did twenty talks in a year after all, seven should be very manageable. Toiling on my talks to the exclusion of so many things in my life, hoping against hope that I’d get some sweet, succulent affirmation, then missing out on a promotion and raise was a real kick in the teeth. In the end, seeing that I could pour my whole being into something and in the end, not accomplish what I truly wanted taught me to focus more active attention on “core” life things: health, friends, family. I did this in order to remove as much outside pressure and distractions as possible, so I can spend 2019 singularly focused on myself and the people in my life. I feel truly confident for the first time in years; like I’m finally making sacrifices for the *right* things. I’m renovating my house and giving away a bunch of my things to create a more stable, clean, beautiful environment for myself. I was more-or-less abandoning self care to go full speed ahead on community work. It’s so hard to know what your limits are without crashing through them like a runaway train fueled by too many salarymen (??????).",LIFE
